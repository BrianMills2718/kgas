# A Systematic Approach to Text Analysis Dimensions

**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Purpose**: Start from first principles to think systematically about text analysis

## 🎯 **First Principles: What is Text Analysis?**

### **Basic Components**

When we analyze text, we have:

1. **The Text** - A linguistic artifact (speech, document, message)
2. **The Analyst** - Someone trying to understand/use the text
3. **The Purpose** - Why the analyst is examining the text
4. **The Tools** - Theories/methods used for analysis
5. **The Output** - What the analyst produces/concludes

### **Fundamental Questions**

Before we can classify types of analysis, we need to ask:
- **What is the analyst trying to achieve?**
- **What counts as a successful analysis?**
- **What kind of claims can be made from text?**

## 🔍 **Different Analytical Goals**

### **Goal 1: Understanding the Text Itself**
**Question**: What are the properties of this linguistic artifact?
**Success**: Accurate characterization of text features
**Example Claims**: 
- "Text contains 47 metaphors"
- "Speech follows problem-solution structure"
- "Message uses formal register"

### **Goal 2: Understanding the Text's Creation**
**Question**: Why does this text exist in this form?
**Success**: Plausible account of authorial/contextual factors
**Example Claims**:
- "Speech crafted to build coalition support"
- "Framing reflects political constraints"
- "Language choices driven by audience expectations"

### **Goal 3: Understanding the Text's Meaning**
**Question**: What is this text communicating?
**Success**: Valid interpretation of intended/received meaning
**Example Claims**:
- "Text argues for increased defense spending"
- "Message implies threat is imminent"
- "Speech positions speaker as strong leader"

### **Goal 4: Understanding the Text's Effects**
**Question**: What will/did this text do to audiences?
**Success**: Accurate prediction/measurement of impact
**Example Claims**:
- "Message will increase support by 10%"
- "Frame will activate loss aversion response"
- "Speech changed public opinion significantly"

### **Goal 5: Understanding the World Through Text**
**Question**: What does this text tell us about external reality?
**Success**: Valid inferences about the world
**Example Claims**:
- "Policy debate has shifted to cost concerns"
- "Alliance relationships are strengthening"
- "Decision-makers exhibit cognitive biases"

## 📊 **A Matrix of Analysis Types**

### **Two Key Dimensions**

**Dimension 1: Object of Study**
- **Text-as-object**: Properties of the linguistic artifact
- **Text-as-window**: What text reveals about something else

**Dimension 2: Type of Claim**
- **Empirical**: What is/was/will be
- **Interpretive**: What it means/meant
- **Evaluative**: How good/effective it is
- **Constructive**: How it should be

### **The Resulting Space**

|                    | Text-as-Object | Text-as-Window |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Empirical**      | Word counts, syntax patterns | Historical events described |
| **Interpretive**   | Rhetorical meanings | Cultural beliefs revealed |
| **Evaluative**     | Message effectiveness | Quality of reasoning shown |
| **Constructive**   | Better writing techniques | Recommended actions |

## 🔧 **Where Theories Fit**

Different theories are tools optimized for different cells in this matrix:

### **Prospect Theory**
- **Primary**: Text-as-window + Interpretive (reveals decision psychology)
- **Secondary**: Text-as-object + Evaluative (assess framing effectiveness)
- **Tertiary**: Text-as-object + Constructive (design better frames)

### **Network Theory**
- **Primary**: Text-as-window + Empirical (reveals relationship structures)
- **Secondary**: Text-as-window + Interpretive (explains power dynamics)
- **Tertiary**: Text-as-object + Empirical (maps rhetorical networks)

### **Framing Theory**
- **Primary**: Text-as-object + Interpretive (identifies frame meanings)
- **Secondary**: Text-as-object + Evaluative (assesses frame resonance)
- **Tertiary**: Text-as-object + Constructive (designs effective frames)

## 💡 **Why the Confusion Arose**

Our analytic tiers (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, prescriptive) are **cutting across these dimensions** in complex ways:

- **"Descriptive"** could mean empirical claims about text OR world
- **"Explanatory"** could mean interpretive claims about meaning OR causal claims about world
- **"Predictive"** assumes temporal orientation but could be about text effects OR world events
- **"Prescriptive"** could mean constructive claims about writing OR about action

## 🎯 **A Cleaner Framework?**

Instead of four tiers, maybe we need to specify:

### **1. Object of Analysis**
- Analyzing properties of text itself
- Using text to analyze something else

### **2. Type of Claim**
- Empirical (what is)
- Interpretive (what means)
- Causal (what causes)
- Evaluative (what's good)
- Constructive (what should be)

### **3. Temporal Orientation**
- Retrospective (what happened)
- Present (what is)
- Prospective (what will be)

### **4. Level of Inference**
- Direct (explicit in text)
- Inferred (implied by text)
- Theorized (brought by analyst)

## 🤔 **The Real Question**

Maybe instead of asking "What analytic tier is this theory?" we should ask:

1. **What kind of questions does this theory help answer?**
2. **What kinds of claims can it support?**
3. **What evidence from text does it use?**
4. **What additional knowledge does it require?**

This might give us a more nuanced and useful framework than trying to force theories into single tiers.

## 🏁 **Next Steps**

Should we:
1. Abandon the tier system for something more multidimensional?
2. Keep tiers but clarify what dimension they refer to?
3. Allow theories to have profiles across multiple dimensions?
4. Focus on use cases rather than abstract classifications?

What do you think would be most useful for the meta-schema's practical application?
