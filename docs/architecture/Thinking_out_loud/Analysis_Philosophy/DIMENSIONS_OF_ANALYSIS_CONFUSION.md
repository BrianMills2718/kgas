# Dimensions of Analysis: Untangling the Conceptual Confusion

**Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Purpose**: Work through the conceptual confusion about what dimensions matter for text analysis

## 🤔 **The Problem with My Examples**

You asked what analytic tier these represent:
- Text-Internal: "Speech uses loss framing because certainty effect increases persuasion"
- Text-External: "Policymakers exhibit loss aversion in the decisions being described"

**The honest answer**: I'm not sure. I think I'm creating false distinctions and forcing examples into categories that may not actually be meaningful.

## 🔍 **Let Me Think Through This More Carefully**

### **What Are We Actually Doing When We Analyze Text?**

**Possibility 1: Analyzing the Text as Linguistic Object**
- Word choice, syntax, rhetorical structure
- "The speech contains 23 military metaphors"
- "Text uses passive voice in 67% of sentences"

**Possibility 2: Analyzing What the Text Claims About Reality**
- Factual assertions, descriptions of events
- "Text states that Soviet military spending increased 40%"
- "Speech describes NATO as having 16 members"

**Possibility 3: Analyzing the Text as Strategic Communication**
- Why certain frames were chosen, intended effects
- "Text uses threat language to build support for defense spending"
- "Speech frames allies as burden-sharers to reduce cost concerns"

**Possibility 4: Analyzing What We Can Infer About Reality from the Text**
- Using text as evidence for claims about the world
- "Speech suggests US sees Soviet threat as increasing"
- "Text indicates alliance burden-sharing is contentious issue"

**Possibility 5: Analyzing Effects the Text Will Have**
- Predicted audience responses, behavioral changes
- "This framing will likely increase public support"
- "Message should be more effective with conservative audiences"

## 🎯 **Are These Actually Distinct Dimensions?**

Looking at my examples again:

**"Speech uses loss framing because certainty effect increases persuasion"**
- This seems to be mixing: Text analysis (uses loss framing) + Strategic communication analysis (because persuasion) + Effect prediction (increases persuasion)

**"Policymakers exhibit loss aversion in the decisions being described"**
- This seems to be: Inference about reality (policymakers exhibit) + Based on text content (decisions described)

## 🤷 **Maybe the Problem is Deeper**

### **Are There Really Clean Boundaries?**

When we analyze text, we're often doing multiple things simultaneously:

1. **Describing** what's there linguistically
2. **Interpreting** what it means  
3. **Inferring** what it tells us about the world
4. **Predicting** what effects it will have
5. **Evaluating** how well it achieves goals
6. **Explaining** why it was crafted this way

These seem to **blend together** rather than existing as distinct categories.

### **Example: "Don't let them take away your Social Security"**

**What am I doing when I analyze this?**
- Describing: Uses imperative mood, possession language, threat framing
- Interpreting: Means "oppose benefit cuts"
- Inferring: Suggests benefit cuts are being proposed
- Predicting: Will likely increase opposition to cuts
- Evaluating: Effective messaging strategy
- Explaining: Uses loss frame because loss aversion makes it more powerful

**These all seem interconnected** - each builds on the others.

## 🔧 **Different Possible Dimensions**

### **Object of Analysis**
- Text properties (linguistic features)
- World properties (what text describes)
- Communication properties (strategic choices)
- Effect properties (audience responses)

### **Temporal Orientation**
- Past: Why was text created this way?
- Present: What does text currently contain/mean?
- Future: What will text do/cause?

### **Level of Analysis**
- Surface: What's explicitly stated
- Deep: What's implied or suggested
- Meta: What the existence of this text tells us

### **Purpose of Analysis**
- Academic understanding
- Strategic evaluation  
- Practical application
- Critical assessment

## 💭 **Maybe the Real Issue**

The analytic tiers (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, prescriptive) might not correspond to **natural joints in reality**. 

Maybe what we're really doing is **asking different questions** that don't fall into neat categories:

- What does this text say?
- What does this text mean?
- Why does this text exist?
- What will this text do?
- How good is this text at its purpose?
- What does this text tell us about the world?
- How should we respond to this text?

And different **theories help us answer different combinations** of these questions, rather than fitting into predetermined analytic boxes.

## 🎯 **Your Point About Difficulty**

You're having difficulty wrapping your head around this because **I may be creating artificial distinctions** that don't actually capture how analysis works in practice.

Maybe the real insight is that analysis is **messier and more integrated** than the neat tier system suggests. We don't cleanly separate "description" from "explanation" from "prediction" - we do them all together as part of making sense of text.

## 🤷 **What Do You Think?**

Are there actually clean dimensions here, or am I overcomplicating something that's naturally more fluid and integrated? 

Maybe the tier system is useful as a rough guide but breaks down when we try to make it too precise?
