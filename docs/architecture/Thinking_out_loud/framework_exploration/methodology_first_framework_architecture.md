# Methodology-First Framework Architecture

## Executive Summary

The KGAS framework organizes theories by their methodological capabilities rather than abstract dimensions. Each theory is classified by the analytical use cases its methodology can reliably support, with quality assessments based on empirical validation evidence. This methodology-first approach ensures that only actionable theories with proven procedures are included, while allowing robust theories to demonstrate versatility across multiple use cases.

## Framework Architecture

### Core Principle: Methodology Determines Classification

Instead of forcing theories into dimensional categories, classify by **methodological capabilities**:

**Framework Structure**:
```
Theory → Methodology Analysis (V13) → Use Case Mapping → Quality Assessment
```

**Classification Logic**:
1. **Methodology Extraction**: What algorithms/procedures does theory provide?
2. **Use Case Mapping**: Which analytical use cases do these methodologies support?
3. **Quality Assessment**: What's the empirical evidence for each use case application?
4. **Multiple Classification**: Theories can support multiple use cases with different quality levels

### V13 Schema Integration

**V13 Methodology Architecture**:
- `algorithms`: Mathematical/logical/procedural methods from theories
- `use_case`: What questions theories answer (analytical use cases)
- `theory_validity_evidence`: Empirical testing and validation
- `validation`: How to test extracted theoretical structures

**Key Principle**: "A theory without methodology is like a physics theory without falsifiable prediction - it's not real science and is basically out of scope because there's nothing you can do with it."

### Primary Use Cases Framework

**Primary Use Cases** (derived from v13 use case patterns):

1. **Assessment**: "What's the current state?"
   - Methodology: Diagnostic algorithms, measurement frameworks
   - V13 Validation: Construct validity, measurement reliability
   - Example: Job Characteristics Model for role design assessment

2. **Explanatory Analysis**: "Why did this happen?"
   - Methodology: Explanatory mechanisms, inference procedures
   - V13 Validation: Internal validity, logical consistency
   - Example: Attribution Theory for performance analysis

3. **Intervention Design**: "How do we change this?"
   - Methodology: Actionable procedures, intervention specification
   - V13 Validation: Practical applications evidence, effectiveness data
   - Example: Goal Setting Theory for motivation interventions

4. **Prediction/Forecasting**: "What will happen if...?"
   - Methodology: Predictive algorithms, boundary condition specification
   - V13 Validation: Predictive validity, replication evidence
   - Example: Technology Acceptance Model for adoption forecasting

5. **Evaluation**: "Did our intervention work?"
   - Methodology: Success criteria specification, measurement protocols
   - V13 Validation: Empirical support, meta-analysis evidence
   - Example: Kirkpatrick Model for training evaluation

## Implementation Architecture

### Theory Admission Criteria (V13 Requirements)
- Must have algorithms (mathematical/logical/procedural)
- Must specify success criteria
- Must have empirical validation evidence
- Must provide actionable methodology

### Use Case Classification with Quality Tiers
```
Theory X:
Primary Use Case: Explanatory Analysis
- Core Methodology: [Specific algorithms from v13]
- Quality Evidence: [Empirical support from v13]
- Validity Score: [Overall credibility from v13]

Secondary Use Cases: Intervention Design, Evaluation
- Extended Methodologies: [Additional algorithms]
- Quality Caveats: [Limitations from v13]
```

### Methodology-Driven Discovery Example
```
User Request: "Why did employee engagement drop?"
System Analysis: 
- Primary Need: Explanatory Analysis use case
- Required Methodology: Explanatory mechanisms + inference procedures
- Quality Filter: Theories with strong internal validity evidence

Recommendations:
1. Self-Determination Theory (High validity, strong explanatory mechanisms)
2. Job Demands-Resources Model (Moderate validity, comprehensive framework)
3. Social Exchange Theory (High validity, well-tested mechanisms)

Each recommendation includes:
- Specific algorithmic procedures from v13
- Expected success criteria
- Quality/reliability assessment
```
