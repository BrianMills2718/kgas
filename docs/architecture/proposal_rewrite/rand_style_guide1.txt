Quick Guide to References and Citations (October 2022)
What's the Difference?
A reference provides complete bibliographic details for a source and is listed with other reference entries at the end of a publication _
A reference helps the reader find the source document.
A citation in the body ofa publication shows the reader where the authors found a specific fact. quotation. or other piece of
information. A citation points the reader to the related full reference entry at the end of the publicatio
Refere n ces
The key elements of any reference entry are the author(s). title, and date of publication Separate these elements with commas. Some
types of sources warrant additional elements For example. references for books include the publisher name; references for journal
articles include the volume and issue number; and references for RAND publications include a link to the publication •s randorg
product page (not the PDF) _ See the next page for more information.

Author-Date System
The first option is to cite sources using just the author surname(s) and the year of publication. referring the reader to the
bibliography or list of references for the source' s full details. •Ihese citations should be supplied in the text. not in footnotes or
endnotes. For example,

Figures, Tables, and Boxes
In figures, tables, and boxes, citations should not appear in a footnote attached to the title or to text in the figure, table, or box.
Instead, place citations in a source line at the bottom ofthe visual itself, using whichever citation system is employed in the rest of the
publication. Furthermore, each source line should identify whether the visual features information from the source material, adapts
a visual found in the source material, or reproduces a visual found in the source material. Separate entries with a semicolon. For
example,
SOURCES: Features information from Elsea and Grimmett, 2011, p. 5; Fearon and Laitin, 2003, pp. '1 6; Judicial Council of
California, 2010, p. 15.

When using text, images, or other content generated by artificial intelligence (Al) as a substantive input to your
document, identify such details as the Al program used and the date or date range that the output was generated.
In some cases, it may be helpful to supply the exact prompt provided to the Al program to help the reader
understand why the program provided that output. Because Al programs individualized content in
response to each prompt, save a digital or hard copy ofthe output in case you need to refer to it later.

Tables and Figures
Tables
The purpose of a table is to put related data side by side to allow comparisons. A single column of information is a
list, not a table.
Column headers should use title case; the rest of the table should use sentence case.
Minimize the use oftable borders, especially vertical borders. For the simplest tables, the only horizontal borders
usually will be above the column header row, below the column header row, and below the last row in the table.
Do not use color or shading in a table as the only means by which to convey information. Tables that use color or
shading in this way are not accessible to nonsighted readers or readers who are colorblind.
Tables are numbered in sequence by chapter (Table S. 1 , Table 4.19) or sequentially throughout the body of the
work (Table 1 , Table 2) for Perspectives and other short publications that aren't divided into chapters.
Each table must be introduced at an appropriate location in the body text—not in a footnote. This mention is
known as its callout, and the table should be placed as soon as possible after its callout. In drafts, position the table
after the paragraph in which it is first mentioned, and there may be text above and below the table. In full-
production publications (see Section R), the table will be positioned either at the top or the bottom of a portrait
page, depending on where the callout is.
Table source lines provide citations, and table notes comment on or clarify information in a table. Any
commentary that applies to the table itself (such as "Lockheed Martin provided these data" or " All values are




± 10 percent") should go in a table source or note line, not a text or endnote. The source line, ifthere is
one, always comes before any table notes. Use lowercase letters for all specific table notes, as demonstrated in this
example and in the RAND manuscript template.
SOURCE: Features information from National Transportation Safety Board, 2020.
NOTE: The adjusted models also included adjustment for age, gender, educational attainment, race and ethnicity,
marital status, and housing status. Full model results are presented in Appendix B.
a This value shows the proportion of motorists who were not convicted of a misdemeanor for speeding.
b These data are for census tracts where there is no VA medical center within a 60-minute drive.
Each source line should identify whether the tablefeatures information from the source material, adapts a table
found in the source material, or reproduces a table found in the source material. (However, when reproducing
content from other sources, visit the Permissions page on the intranet for important information.)
SOURCES: Features information from Erwin and Saunders, 2020; Japanese Ministry Of Foreign Affairs,
2022; Office Of the Under Secretary Of Defense (Comptroller), 2021.
SOURCE: Adapted from Swedish Defence Research Agency, 2019, Table 12.
If no citation is given for a table (or figure), the content is assumed to have been generated by the authors during
research or writing. Thus, unless a visual employs or features data or information from a source other than the
authors, no source line is needed. This means that such source lines as "Author-generated," "Authors' analysis,"
and "RAND analysis" are unnecessary. See Section D for more information.

Smith, citing Fisher (1985), argues that political parties provide dramatic tension for storytellers: “therefore, an examination of the internal workings of an artifact such as a party platform—a product of an established institution—may yield insights regarding those narrators, the institutions, and their perceived conditions” (Smith 1989, 94).
