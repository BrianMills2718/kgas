# Annex A: Theory Meta-Schema Specification

## A.1 Theory Meta-Schema Architecture

The Theory Meta-Schema provides a standardized format for representing social science theories in machine-readable form while preserving their original terminology and theoretical structure. This specification enables computational application while maintaining theoretical fidelity.

## A.2 Core Schema Components

### Metadata Component
Preserves bibliographic information and theoretical relationships:
- Original authors and publication details
- Connections to related theories through extension, synthesis, or contradiction
- Scope boundaries and application conditions
- Version tracking for schema evolution

### Theoretical Structure Component
Defines entities, relations, and modifiers using indigenous terminology:
- **Entities**: Core concepts with original definitions and properties
- **Relations**: Connections between entities with logical properties (causal, correlational, moderating)
- **Modifiers**: Conditions that affect theoretical elements (boundary conditions, assumptions)

### Computational Representation Component
Specifies how theoretical structures map to data formats:
- **Graph representations**: Network relationships, nodes, and edges
- **Table representations**: Statistical variables and relationships
- **Vector representations**: Semantic similarity comparisons
- **Natural language**: Textual descriptions and explanations

### Algorithms Component
Contains the theory's analytical methods:
- **Mathematical formulas**: Quantitative relationships and calculations
- **Logical rules**: Conditional statements and decision trees
- **Procedural steps**: Sequential operations and workflows
- **Temporal sequences**: Time-based progressions and stages

## A.3 Methodology Type Specifications

### FORMULAS
Mathematical equations that quantify theoretical relationships:
- Social Learning Theory: Behavior_adoption = Σ(observed_behavior × tie_strength × outcome_valence)
- Social Identity Theory: In_group_favoritism = (in_group_rating - out_group_rating) / scale_range
- Diffusion rate calculations based on network topology

### ALGORITHMS
Computational procedures for complex calculations:
- Breadth-first search for influence cascade tracing
- Community detection for group identification
- PageRank variants for influence measurement
- Clustering algorithms for semantic grouping

### PROCEDURES
Step-by-step processes for analysis:
- Spiral of Silence decision process:
  1. Assess opinion climate from network
  2. Calculate perceived majority position
  3. Evaluate isolation risk
  4. Determine expression likelihood
  5. Generate expression decision

### RULES
Logical conditions and consequences:
- IF mortality_salience = high AND worldview_threat = present THEN worldview_defense = increased
- IF group_identity = strong AND out_group_threat = perceived THEN in_group_bias = amplified
- IF information contradicts prior_beliefs AND motivation = high THEN source_credibility = discounted

### SEQUENCES
Temporal patterns and progressions:
- McGuire's persuasion sequence: exposure → attention → comprehension → yielding → retention → behavior
- Radicalization pathway: grievance → seeking → finding → bonding → commitment → action
- Innovation adoption: awareness → interest → evaluation → trial → adoption

## A.5 Cross-Theory Integration Patterns

Theories can be combined to provide multi-perspective analysis:

### Complementary Integration
- Social Identity Theory + Terror Management Theory: Group identity as mortality salience buffer
- Motivated Reasoning + Spiral of Silence: Cognitive and social factors in expression
- Diffusion of Innovations + Social Learning: Innovation spread through observation

### Hierarchical Integration
- Individual level: Cognitive Dissonance, Motivated Reasoning
- Group level: Social Identity Theory, Social Proof
- Society level: Cultivation Theory, Agenda Setting

### Sequential Integration
- Initial exposure: Elaboration Likelihood Model
- Group influence: Social Identity Theory
- Behavioral change: Theory of Planned Behavior
- Maintenance: Social Learning Theory

## A.6 Implementation Guidelines

### Theory Extraction Process
1. Identify theory source documents
2. Extract core constructs using meta-schema
3. Map relationships and mechanisms
4. Specify computational operations
5. Validate against empirical patterns

### Quality Assurance
- Theoretical fidelity: Preserve original terminology
- Computational validity: Ensure operations match theory
- Empirical grounding: Connect to measurable outcomes
- Cross-validation: Multiple extraction attempts
- Expert review: Domain specialist verification

### Schema Evolution
The meta-schema supports versioning to accommodate:
- New theoretical developments
- Refined computational methods
- Extended analytical capabilities
- Integration patterns
- Validation improvements
