## Key Changes from Original Proposal

### Academic Integrity Safeguards
- All claims use "will demonstrate" framing
- No assertions of existing functionality
- Positioned as "proof-of-concept infrastructure"
- Clear scope limitations acknowledged

### Terminology Standardization
- ✅ "Construct Estimate" (not "Computational Proxy")
- ✅ Larson's levels (individual/group/mass public)
- ✅ "To Whom" (not "Whom")
- ✅ "Settings" added to Lasswell framework
- ✅ No SME validation (crowd-sourced instead)

### Content Improvements
- 19% text reduction achieved (from 599 to 485 lines)
- COVID conspiracy dataset example prominently featured
- ABM with Kunst personality characteristics detailed
- Reasoned Action Model as structured approach included
- Comparison to GraphRAG/Standard RAG added
- Cross-modal analysis architecture explained

### Validation Approach
- Crowd-sourced coding for extraction accuracy
- Correlation with psychological scales as primary method
- No predetermined performance targets
- Uncertainty propagation example with IC standards
