# Assessment of Proof-of-Concept Tone Recommendations

## ✅ Already Implemented in Current Proposal

1. **No predetermined performance targets** - Already using "without predetermined targets" throughout validation sections
2. **"Will demonstrate" framing** - Consistently using future tense and "will demonstrate" language
3. **Avoiding effect size promises** - No specific percentage improvements claimed
4. **Focus on limitations** - Explicit limitations sections in Chapters 2, 8, and 9
5. **Uncertainty propagation example** - Now added to Annex C with worked example

## 🟡 Partially Aligned - Minor Adjustments Recommended

### 1. Purpose Statement Refinement
**Current**: "This dissertation will demonstrate computational methods for extracting psychological construct estimates..."

**Recommended adjustment**: Add engineering language while keeping academic tone:
"This dissertation will demonstrate and document the feasibility of theory-aware computational discourse analysis, profiling current capabilities and limitations as infrastructure for future research."

### 2. Research Questions - Add Process Metrics
Keep current RQs but add process characterization in validation:
- Report extraction times (aiming for <60s per theory)
- Document failure modes and error frequencies
- Report cross-modal conversion metrics (edge-loss rates, cosine drift)

### 3. Validation Metrics Enhancement
Add these process metrics to Chapter 8:
- **Extraction metrics**: Time per theory, % elements captured
- **DAG metrics**: Average nodes/depth, auto-resolved vs manual links
- **Cross-modal metrics**: Conversion loss rates, runtime performance

## 🔴 Not Recommended for This Proposal

### 1. Complete RQ Restatement
The suggested engineering-focused RQs would fundamentally change the dissertation's academic positioning. Current RQs are appropriate for a social science dissertation while still being modest about claims.

### 2. Analyst Walk-throughs
While valuable, adding 3-4 domain expert evaluations would require IRB approval and extend timeline. This could be future work.

### 3. Excessive Hedging Language
The proposal already uses appropriate academic caution. Adding too many "could indicate" and "may facilitate" would weaken the writing.

## ✅ Recommended Minor Edits to Incorporate

### Chapter 1 Opening (Line 5)
**Add after current opening**: 
"The system documents end-to-end feasibility of theory-aware analysis, profiling present capabilities as infrastructure for future, more powerful language models."

### Chapter 8.1 (Line 458)
**Add**: "Validation includes process metrics (extraction time, DAG complexity, conversion rates) alongside theoretical validation."

### Chapter 8.5 (Line 474)
**Add**: "Process metrics establish operational baselines: median extraction time per theory, percentage of elements captured, and cross-modal conversion loss rates."

### Chapter 9.3 (Line 490)
**Strengthen infrastructure framing**: 
"KGAS serves as proof-of-concept infrastructure, with current metrics providing baselines for next-generation systems."

## Summary

The proposal already incorporates most proof-of-concept principles:
- ✅ No accuracy boasting
- ✅ Transparent about limitations
- ✅ Focuses on demonstrating feasibility
- ✅ Avoids predetermined targets
- ✅ Includes uncertainty propagation example

Minor additions of process metrics and infrastructure framing would strengthen the proof-of-concept tone without requiring major restructuring. The current academic framing is appropriate for a dissertation while maintaining modest claims about capabilities.
