PROPOSAL VERSION

This study does not involve interaction with, or the collection of identifiable private information from, human subjects. The project will analyze publicly available documents and online content (e.g., social media discourse, policy documents) using an automated Knowledge Graph Analysis System (KGAS). While the system will be iteratively refined based on internal testing, any feedback gathered from subject matter experts (SMEs) regarding the use or usability of the tool will be confined to internal RAND staff, and no identifiable or sensitive data will be collected.

Consistent with RAND HSPC policy and 45 CFR 46.102(e)(1), this activity is not considered “human subjects research” as defined under federal regulations. However, all activities will be submitted for HSPC screening prior to execution to confirm this determination and to ensure ongoing compliance. If any subsequent activities involve systematic collection of evaluative data from SMEs with the intent to contribute to generalizable knowledge, a modification will be submitted for HSPC review and approval.

The project will adhere to RAND’s policies and procedures for safeguarding data, including those outlined in the Standard Operating Procedures and the Policy on the Protection of Human Subjects and Ethical Treatment of Research Participants. No collection, use, or disclosure of identifiable private information is planned, and no consent processes (including waivers) are required under current project design. Should this change, the study team will seek appropriate HSPC review and approval.

FULL VERSION

Human Subjects Protections Statement – Full Version

This project does not involve interaction with, intervention upon, or collection of identifiable private information from living individuals and thus does not constitute human subjects research under the definitions provided in 45 CFR 46.102(e)(1). The core research activities involve the analysis of publicly available online discourse and digital documents—including but not limited to social media content, policy statements, fringe epistemic narratives, and public communications—using a proprietary automated Knowledge Graph Analysis System (KGAS).

All data utilized for primary analysis will be non-interactive and non-identifiable, and will be derived exclusively from sources in the public domain. No attempts will be made to de-anonymize users, triangulate identity, or link behavioral content to any personally identifiable information (PII). No demographic metadata, contact information, or user credentials will be harvested, stored, or analyzed.

The KGAS tool itself will be iteratively refined through internal testing and quality assessment. Input from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) may be solicited on an informal basis to assess the system’s usability, analytical affordances, or interpretability. These SMEs will be limited to RAND internal staff acting in a professional capacity. No evaluative data about the SMEs themselves will be collected, and no feedback mechanisms will include identifiers, be systematically recorded, or used to draw generalizable conclusions about human performance, cognition, or experience.

Consistent with RAND’s Human Subjects Protection Committee (HSPC) policy and applicable federal regulations, this study will be submitted for HSPC screening review to confirm that it qualifies as “Not Human Subjects Research.” This submission will take place prior to initiation of data analysis or SME engagement. Should the study scope evolve to include systematic data collection from individuals, evaluative feedback intended for generalizable inference, or use of identifiable or private information, the study team will submit a modification for full HSPC review and will not proceed until approval is secured.

The research team affirms adherence to RAND’s governing documentation on research ethics and human subjects protection, including the:

    Policy on the Protection of Human Subjects and Ethical Treatment of Research Participants;
    HSPC Standard Operating Procedures (SOP);
    Federalwide Assurance FWA00003425;
    and relevant provisions of the Revised Common Rule (45 CFR 46).

No informed consent procedures (active or waived) are necessary under the current design. No audio, video, or biometric data will be collected. No use of deception, manipulation, or engagement with vulnerable populations (as defined in Subparts B-D of 45 CFR 46) is planned or permitted under the scope of this activity.

Should any unforeseen developments necessitate reconsideration of this classification, the Principal Investigator will immediately notify the HSPC and submit appropriate documentation to ensure uninterrupted compliance with RAND policy and federal regulation.

✅ COVERED IN THE STATEMENT

📜 Federal Regulatory Compliance

    45 CFR 46.102(e)(1) – Definition of human subjects
    Revised Common Rule compliance
    Explicit declaration of non-human subjects research
    Statement on triggering HSPC review if project scope changes

🧾 RAND Institutional Requirements

    Federalwide Assurance (FWA00003425)
    IRB registration number (IRB00000051)
    DoD Addendum (F50389) (implicitly covered via HSPC procedures)
    Screening review commitment via RHINO

🔐 Data Protection and Consent

    No collection of identifiable private information (PII, PHI)
    No interaction or intervention with individuals
    No passive, implied, or opt-out consent (aligned with HSPC policy)
    No use of deception, special populations, or manipulations
    Reference to Data Safeguarding Plans (DSP)

⚙️ Operational Procedures

    Use of public domain materials only
    SME feedback described as internal, informal, non-systematic
    Feedback not used for generalizable knowledge
    Covered against “mission creep” that might trigger HSPC reclassification
    Clear protocol for submitting modification if any scope changes arise

🧠 Training & SOP Adherence

    Acknowledgment of RAND SOPs and ethical obligations
    CITI training obligations implied if human subjects work later arises

💡 Future-proofing

    Addresses hypothetical changes in scope
    Satisfies both minimal risk and non-exempt categorizations if design shifts

 

🔒 Bottom Line

You do not need to redo this documentation review unless the project design changes materially (e.g., if you:

    collect new data from identifiable individuals,
    solicit structured SME evaluation for generalizable claims,
    integrate private or restricted-access datasets,
    engage vulnerable or external participants,
    or apply for external funding requiring IRB assurance).

Until then, this statement is airtight for RAND HSPC and IRB requirements. You're clear.
