# Historical Phases

**Purpose**: Archive of completed phases that preceded the current A-D phase system

## Phase System Evolution

The current KGAS project uses phases **A**, **B**, **C**, **D** as documented in [ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md](../../ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md):
- **Phase A**: Natural Language Interface ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase B**: Dynamic Execution & Intelligent Orchestration ✅ COMPLETE  
- **Phase C**: Multi-Document Cross-Modal Intelligence ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase D**: Production Optimization + Theory Integration 🔄 CURRENT

## Historical Phases (Archived)

These phases used the old numbered system and represent completed foundational work:

### Phase 0: Foundation Setup
- Implementation evidence and initial setup work
- Task files preserved in `phase-0-tasks/`

### Phase 1: Foundation Optimization  
- Configuration consolidation and developer experience improvements
- Implementation plans and results preserved
- Task files preserved in `phase-1-tasks/`

### Phase 2: Tool Expansion
- Strategic tool expansion and analytical capabilities
- Performance optimization work
- Task files preserved in `phase-2-tasks/`

### Phase 3: Research Focus
- Research-oriented capabilities
- Implementation evidence for phases 3-5 combined

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Advanced system capabilities

## Relationship to Current System

These historical phases provided the foundation that enabled the current A-D system. While the numbering system changed, the foundational work remains valid and should be preserved as evidence of completion.

## File Organization

All files maintain their original names and internal structure for historical accuracy. Cross-references within historical files are preserved as-is.
