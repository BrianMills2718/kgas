# Roadmap Documentation Improvement Index
# Created: 2025-08-05
# Purpose: Systematic roadmap documentation cleanup and organization

# ⚠️ UNCERTAINTIES TO RESOLVE FIRST:
# 1. What is the actual current system status? (I only know documentation claims)
# 2. Are there external references to current file paths that would break if moved?
# 3. Should any files be preserved exactly as-is for historical reasons?
# 4. What's the preferred level of aggressiveness for changes?
# 5. Are there hidden dependencies between tasks that would affect ordering?

# RECOMMENDED EXECUTION ORDER
# =============================================================================

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Days 1-3)
## Goal: Establish ground truth and prevent further confusion

### 1.1 Current Status Audit (Day 1)
- [ ] Verify actual system implementation vs. ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md claims
  - Check if Phases A, B, C are actually complete as claimed
  - Verify test counts (76/81 tests passing claim)
  - Confirm theory extraction system status in /experiments/lit_review
  - Validate which tools actually exist and work
- [ ] Document findings in: docs/roadmap/ACTUAL_STATUS_AUDIT_20250805.md
- [ ] Create definitive "CURRENT REALITY" baseline document

### 1.2 Create Backup (Day 1)
- [ ] Create full backup of current roadmap state
- [ ] Archive to: docs/roadmap/ARCHIVE_BEFORE_CLEANUP_20250805/
- [ ] Document what was archived and why

### 1.3 Critical Priority Triage (Day 2)
- [ ] Identify which initiatives are actually blocking current work
- [ ] Separate "truly urgent" from "claimed urgent but actually future"
- [ ] Create priority classification:
  - BLOCKING_NOW: Actually preventing current development
  - HIGH_CURRENT: Important for current phase
  - FUTURE: Important but not current blockers
  - HISTORICAL: Complete or superseded

### 1.4 Phase Naming Standards (Day 3)
- [ ] Create definitive phase naming convention document
- [ ] Map old numbered phases to current A→D system
- [ ] Identify files that need renaming vs. archiving vs. updating

## PHASE 2: STRUCTURAL CLEANUP (Days 4-7)
## Goal: Fix naming and organizational issues

### 2.1 Phase File Standardization (Day 4)
- [ ] Rename all phase files to consistent A→D naming
- [ ] Update internal references within renamed files
- [ ] Archive files that don't fit current system
- [ ] Create redirect/mapping document for any external references

### 2.2 Directory Consolidation (Day 5)
- [ ] Merge redundant analysis directories
  - Consolidate /analysis/ and /analysis/kgas-specific/
  - Preserve content, eliminate structure duplication
- [ ] Clarify /initiatives/ vs /post-mvp/ boundaries
  - Move truly current initiatives to /initiatives/
  - Move truly future items to /post-mvp/
- [ ] Create clear purpose statements for each directory

### 2.3 File Naming Standardization (Day 6)
- [ ] Apply consistent naming conventions:
  - phase-X-*.md for phase files
  - task-X.Y-*.md for task files
  - initiative-*.md for cross-cutting initiatives
- [ ] Update all internal cross-references
- [ ] Create mapping document for renamed files

### 2.4 Priority Location Fixes (Day 7)
- [ ] Move truly critical items to appropriate current locations
- [ ] Move future items to post-mvp where they belong
- [ ] Update ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md to reflect corrected priorities

## PHASE 3: CONTENT RECONCILIATION (Days 8-11)
## Goal: Fix contradictory and outdated information

### 3.1 Implementation Claims Audit (Day 8)
- [ ] Review all "COMPLETE", "READY", "IMPLEMENTED" claims
- [ ] Cross-check against actual system capabilities
- [ ] Flag contradictions for resolution
- [ ] Update status claims to match reality

### 3.2 Timeline Information Update (Day 9)
- [ ] Update all dates to current context (2025-08-05 baseline)
- [ ] Remove outdated timeline estimates
- [ ] Align timeline information with actual progress
- [ ] Identify and update dependency chains

### 3.3 Technical Specification Accuracy (Day 10)
- [ ] Audit tool counts, performance metrics, capability claims
- [ ] Cross-check against actual implementation
- [ ] Update specifications to match current system
- [ ] Flag items that need verification

### 3.4 Theory Integration Status Clarification (Day 11)
- [ ] Reconcile theory extraction documentation inconsistencies
- [ ] Clarify experimental vs. integrated status
- [ ] Update integration timeline to current reality
- [ ] Align with actual MVP requirements

## PHASE 4: INTEGRATION AND FINALIZATION (Days 12-14)
## Goal: Create cohesive, cross-referenced documentation

### 4.1 Cross-Reference Creation (Day 12)
- [ ] Add proper cross-references between related documents
- [ ] Create navigation aids between phase files and tasks
- [ ] Link initiatives to implementation status
- [ ] Add "Related Documents" sections where missing

### 4.2 Master Index Creation (Day 13)
- [ ] Update ROADMAP_OVERVIEW.md as single source of truth
- [ ] Create comprehensive document index
- [ ] Add navigation guide for finding specific information
- [ ] Ensure all major content is discoverable

### 4.3 Final Validation (Day 14)
- [ ] Review all changes for internal consistency
- [ ] Verify no broken internal links
- [ ] Confirm priority alignment throughout
- [ ] Test navigation paths for common use cases

## PHASE 5: DOCUMENTATION AND HANDOFF (Day 15)
## Goal: Document changes and establish maintenance procedures

### 5.1 Change Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive change log
- [ ] Document new organization structure
- [ ] Explain rationale for major changes
- [ ] Create transition guide for anyone referencing old structure

### 5.2 Maintenance Procedures
- [ ] Document how to maintain organization going forward
- [ ] Create guidelines for adding new content
- [ ] Establish review procedures for status updates
- [ ] Define responsibilities for keeping documentation current

# =============================================================================
# SPECIFIC FILE ACTIONS
# =============================================================================

## FILES TO RENAME (Phase 2.1):
- phase-1-implementation.md → phase-historical-foundation.md (archive)
- phase-2-implementation.md → phase-historical-expansion.md (archive)
- [Need status audit to determine current phase mapping]

## FILES TO MOVE (Phase 2.2):
- bi-store-consistency-plan.md → [Need priority audit - current or post-mvp?]
- phase-reliability/* → [Need status audit - current blocker or historical?]
- theory-extraction-integration-plan.md → [Confirm if current MVP critical]

## FILES TO MERGE (Phase 2.2):
- /analysis/README.md + /analysis/kgas-specific/ content
- Multiple performance tracking files

## FILES NEEDING CONTENT AUDIT (Phase 3.1):
- phase-theory-to-code-implementation-plan.md (claims vs. reality)
- phase-reliability/README.md (blocking claims vs. current status)
- two-layer-theory-implementation-status.md (integration requirements)

- [ ] Current timeline information throughout

## Phase 4 Success:

# =============================================================================
# DEPENDENCIES AND RISKS
# =============================================================================

## Critical Dependencies:
- Status audit results will determine many subsequent actions
- Priority triage affects where files should be moved
- External references may constrain renaming options

## Key Risks:
- Breaking external references to roadmap files
- Losing important historical information
- Creating new inconsistencies while fixing old ones
- Over-reorganizing and making system harder to use

## Mitigation Strategies:
- Complete backup before any changes
- Create mapping documents for all renames/moves
- Validate each phase before proceeding to next
- Conservative approach to changes without clear benefit

# NOTES
# =============================================================================

This index assumes 15 working days for complete roadmap reorganization.
Timeline can be compressed if narrower scope is acceptable.
Each phase builds on previous phases - order is important.
Regular validation checkpoints prevent compound errors.
