# Tool Count Methodology

**Document Purpose**: Standardize tool counting across all documentation  
**Created**: 2025-06-19  
**Status**: OFFICIAL COUNTING STANDARD

## Executive Summary

**Official Tool Count**: 13 Core GraphRAG Tools  
**Total Available Tools**: 33 (13 core + 20 MCP server tools)  
**Methodology**: Count by functional verification, not file count

## Counting Standards

### 1. What Counts as a "Tool"

A tool is counted if it meets ALL criteria:
- ✅ Has a complete implementation (not stub/placeholder)
- ✅ Can be invoked and produces results
- ✅ Has been functionally verified with test data
- ✅ Provides distinct functionality (not just a variant)

### 2. What Does NOT Count

The following are NOT counted as separate tools:
- ❌ Base classes or abstract implementations
- ❌ Optimized variants of the same functionality
- ❌ Test utilities or helper functions
- ❌ Archived or experimental implementations
- ❌ Duplicate implementations with same functionality

### 3. Official Tool Breakdown

#### Core GraphRAG Tools (13 Total)

### 4. File Count vs Functional Count

**File Count Reality** (~19 files):
- Phase 1: 11 files (includes base classes, variants)
- Phase 2: 4 files (includes unused enhanced versions)
- Phase 3: 4 files (includes experimental code)

**Functional Count Reality** (13 tools):
- Only count tools that meet ALL criteria above
- Exclude duplicates, variants, and experiments
- Focus on distinct, working functionality

### 5. Reporting Standards

When reporting tool counts in documentation:
1. Always use functional count (13) as primary metric
2. Clarify if discussing file count vs functional count
3. Reference this document for methodology
4. Update counts only after functional verification

### 6. Verification Commands

```bash
# Count functional tools (correct method)
python scripts/verify_tool_functionality.py

# Count tool files (for reference only)
find src/tools -name "*.py" -type f | grep -v __pycache__ | wc -l
```
