# Archived Performance Requirements

**Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Reason**: Performance content contained demanding targets and requirements, moved to align with preference for observation-based tracking

## Archived Files

### benchmark-results.md
- **Original Purpose**: Performance benchmark results with specific targets
- **Issue**: Contains rigid performance requirements and pass/fail criteria
- **Specific Problems**:
  - "Performance Against Targets" section with hard requirements
  - Pass/fail status indicators (✅ Exceeded, etc.)
  - Prescriptive performance mandates (< 2s/doc, > 500/s, etc.)
- **Value**: Contains useful measurement methodology and actual observations
- **Future Use**: Can be referenced for measurement techniques without adopting the targets

### performance-baseline-procedures.md  
- **Original Purpose**: Standardized procedures for establishing performance baselines
- **Issue**: Contains requirements language and complex implementation schedules
- **Specific Problems**:
  - "Performance targets" and "improvement factors" 
  - "Success Metrics" with specific pass/fail criteria
  - Overwhelming implementation schedules and mandatory procedures
- **Value**: Excellent measurement methodology and baseline establishment techniques
- **Future Use**: Measurement procedures can be adapted for observation-focused approach

## Context

The user prefers to **track performance without demanding specific requirements**. The original files focused on:
- Setting specific performance targets
- Pass/fail evaluation criteria  
- Rigid benchmarking requirements
- Mandatory improvement schedules

This approach was misaligned with the preference for **observation-based performance tracking** that focuses on understanding system behavior without creating pressure to meet specific benchmarks.

## Replacement Approach

The performance directory now contains lightweight, observation-focused tracking that:
- Records performance observations without judgments
- Tracks trends and patterns over time
- Identifies areas of interest without setting requirements
- Maintains useful measurement techniques without mandates

## Value Preservation

The measurement methodologies, baseline establishment techniques, and observation frameworks from these files remain valuable for future reference, but without the demanding requirements structure.
