# Agent Intelligence Enhancements

**Category**: Advanced agent intelligence and workflow automation  
**Timeline**: Post-MVP implementation after core functionality is stable  
**Focus**: Enhancing agent capabilities beyond basic workflow execution

## Current Enhancements

### adaptive_workflow_replanning_enhancement.md
- **Purpose**: Enable WorkflowAgent to dynamically adapt workflows based on execution results
- **Problem**: Current static workflows cannot handle unexpected data characteristics
- **Solution**: Real-time workflow replanning and tool selection optimization
- **Priority**: High - Significantly improves agent intelligence

### relationship_identity_resolution_enhancement.md  
- **Purpose**: Advanced relationship deduplication and identity resolution for T34 Edge Builder
- **Problem**: Duplicate relationship edges created across multiple documents
- **Solution**: Sophisticated relationship identity matching and merging
- **Priority**: Medium - Improves graph quality and consistency

## Enhancement Categories

### Workflow Intelligence
- Dynamic workflow adaptation
- Tool selection optimization
- Error recovery and replanning
- Performance-based routing

### Data Intelligence  
- Advanced entity resolution
- Relationship identity matching
- Cross-document consistency
- Quality-driven processing

## Implementation Notes

These enhancements focus on making agents truly intelligent rather than just following predefined workflows. They represent the next evolution beyond basic workflow execution toward adaptive, learning-capable research automation.

## Prerequisites

All enhancements require:
- Stable core workflow execution (current MVP)
- Reliable tool integration and error handling
- Comprehensive tool contracts and metadata
- Performance monitoring and feedback systems
