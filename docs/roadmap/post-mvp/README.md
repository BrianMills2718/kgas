# Post-MVP Initiatives

**Purpose**: Future initiatives and enhancements planned after MVP completion  
**Status**: These initiatives are planned for after core functionality is stable  

## Directory Purpose

This directory contains initiatives that are:
- **Future-focused**: Not current Phase D priorities
- **Enhancement-oriented**: Improvements rather than core fixes
- **Research-directed**: Academic research workflow enhancements
- **Performance-focused**: Optimization initiatives

## Current MVP Scope

The MVP focuses on core entity resolution and tool auto-discovery issues. Post-MVP initiatives will be moved here to maintain clear focus on immediate priorities.

## Current Post-MVP Content

### Agent Intelligence Enhancements
- **[Adaptive Workflow Replanning](agent-intelligence/adaptive_workflow_replanning_enhancement.md)** - Dynamic workflow adaptation based on execution results
- **[Relationship Identity Resolution](agent-intelligence/relationship_identity_resolution_enhancement.md)** - Advanced relationship deduplication and merging

### Performance & Optimization
- **[Performance Requirements](performance-requirements/)** - Detailed benchmarking frameworks and rigid performance targets (archived from current roadmap)

### Future Phase Development (Moved from /phases/)
- **`phase-6-spacy-optimization-plan.md`** - SpaCy optimization planning
- **`phase-7/`** - Service architecture completion planning
- **`phase-8.8-agent-integration-plan.md`** - Agent integration planning
- **`phase-8.8-agent-orchestration-design.md`** - Agent orchestration design
- **`phase-8.9-ui-integration-plan.md`** - UI integration planning
- **`phase-8/`** - Strategic external integrations
- **`phase-reliability/`** - Reliability improvements and architecture fixes
- **`phase-tdd/`** - Test-driven development methodology
- **`phase-technical-debt/`** - Technical debt remediation
- **`phase-theory-to-code/`** - Advanced theory automation (beyond current integration)
- **`phase-universal-llm/`** - Universal LLM integration

## Initiative Categories

### Agent Intelligence & Automation
