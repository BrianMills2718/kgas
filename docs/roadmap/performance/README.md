# Performance Tracking

**Purpose**: Observational performance tracking without demanding specific requirements.

## Approach

This directory focuses on **understanding system performance** rather than **demanding performance requirements**:

- ✅ **Track observations** about how the system performs
- ✅ **Identify patterns** and trends over time  
- ✅ **Note areas of interest** for potential future attention
- ❌ **Avoid rigid targets** or pass/fail criteria
- ❌ **No demanding benchmarks** or mandatory optimization schedules
- ❌ **No pressure** to meet specific performance numbers

## Files

### performance-journal.md
- **Current observations** about system performance
- **Trends and patterns** noticed over time
- **Areas of interest** worth keeping an eye on
- **Simple measurement guidance** for when curiosity arises

## Philosophy

Performance tracking should **inform and educate** rather than **demand and pressure**. The goal is to understand how the system behaves and ensure it supports research workflows effectively.

## Archived Requirements

Detailed performance measurement procedures and rigid benchmarking frameworks have been moved to `/docs/roadmap/post-mvp/performance-requirements/` for potential future reference without creating current pressure.
