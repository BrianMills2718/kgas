## Semantic Versioning Policy

### Version Bump Rules

| Bump | Trigger | Compatibility |
|------|---------|---------------|
| MAJOR | remove/rename field, change dolce_parent | breaking |
| MINOR | add optional field, new subclass | backward-compatible |
| PATCH | typo or label edit | metadata-only |

### Version Bump Requirements
**PRs must include a justified version bump in each modified MCL or theory file.**

### Version Bump Examples
```yaml
# MAJOR version bump (breaking change)
theory_schema:
  version: "2.0.0"  # Was 1.0.0
  # Removed field: old_field
  # Changed dolce_parent: new_parent_iri

# MINOR version bump (backward-compatible)
theory_schema:
  version: "1.1.0"  # Was 1.0.0
  # Added optional field: new_optional_field

# PATCH version bump (metadata-only)
theory_schema:
  version: "1.0.1"  # Was 1.0.0
  # Fixed typo in description
```

---

## Theory Schema Development

### Schema Standards
- **DOLCE Alignment**: Every entity must have dolce_parent
- **MCL Integration**: Every entity must have mcl_id
- **Validation**: All schemas must pass validation
- **Documentation**: Include clear descriptions

### Schema Example
```json
{
  "theory_id": "social_identity_theory",
  "theory_name": "Social Identity Theory",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "classification": {
    "domain": {
      "level": "Meso",
      "component": "Whom",
      "metatheory": "Structural"
    }
  },
  "ontology": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "name": "SocialIdentity",
        "dolce_parent": "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Person",
        "mcl_id": "social_identity_001",
        "properties": [
          {
            "name": "group_membership",
            "type": "List[SocialGroup]"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Writing a ToolPlugin

You can extend KGAS by writing a ToolPlugin or PhasePlugin. Plugins are discovered via setuptools entry points.

### Example: setup.py
```python
from setuptools import setup
setup(
    name='my_kgas_plugin',
    version='0.1',
    py_modules=['my_plugin'],
    entry_points={
        'kgas.plugins': [
            'my_tool = my_plugin:MyToolPlugin',
        ],
    },
)
```

### Example: my_plugin.py
```python
class MyToolPlugin:
    def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print('Hello from MyToolPlugin!')
```

- See PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md for contract and loading details.

## Documentation Bucket Placement

All documentation must reside in exactly **one** of the three buckets:

1. `docs/architecture/` – evergreen architecture & specs.
2. `docs/roadmap/` – development roadmap and forward-looking planning.
3. `docs/public/` – user-facing guidance and tutorials.

### When adding or updating documentation

- Place the file in the correct bucket and **avoid duplicates**.
- Update the root `TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md` so newcomers can find it quickly.
- Run the Markdown linter locally (`npm run docs:lint`) or wait for the CI check.
- **Modifying files inside `docs/archive/` is prohibited.**  Create a new doc instead and reference the archived version if needed.
