hypergraphs i think can have multiple meanings. i think i mean it in both senses, but most immediately in the sense of capturing n-ary and multip hop relations that go beyond triples. Typedb (formerly graken) is a interesting template for this "N-ary Relations
In the real world, relations aren’t just binary connections between two things. That’s why it’s often necessary to capture three or more things related with each other at once. Representing them as separate binary relationships would lead to a loss of information, which is what happens in graph databases. TypeDB, on the other hand, can naturally represent an arbitrary number of things as one relation, for example, without needing to reify the model.
In the example below, the n-ary relation cast connects three different entities: a person entity, a character entity, and a movie entity:Copymatch
 
$person isa person, has name "Leonardo";
$character isa character, has name "Jack";
$movie isa movie, has name $movie-name;
(actor: $person, character: $character, movie: $movie) isa cast;
get $movie-name;
".from a conceptual level i want to root this from the ground up in phenomenology in the sense that all semantics has to be rooted in concious experience for it to be meaningful, i.e. that which can not be perceived can not be talked about, or in other words all semantics is a representation of concious phenomenology. from a more technical level I think the following paper provides some interesting groundword for thinking about this ""Let me analyze what you're saying and connect it to the documents and broader context:
You're making two key points about hypergraphs:

Technical/Structural Perspective: You're referencing how hypergraphs can represent n-ary relations (beyond just triples) and multi-hop relationships. This aligns with what's described in the document, particularly this quote:
"Hypergraphs strictly generalize graphs (all graphs are (2-uniform) hypergraphs), and thus can represent additional data complexity and have more mathematical properties to exploit (for example, hyperedges can be contained in other hyperedges)."
Philosophical/Phenomenological Perspective: You're suggesting that semantic meaning needs to be grounded in conscious experience - that we can only meaningfully talk about things that can be perceived in some way.

Your connection to TypeDB is interesting because it shows a practical implementation of n-ary relations. Looking at the HyperNetX paper, we can see they're doing something similar but with a different approach. From the document:
"Since AIDA events can have n slots (and relations can have two), we represent them as whole n‐ary hyperedges as part of a hypergraph knowledgebase, rather than as reified graphs linking to n arguments."
Would you like me to:

Explore more how HyperNetX specifically implements n-ary relations?
Discuss how the phenomenological grounding could be represented in hypergraph structures?
Compare the TypeDB and HyperNetX approaches to handling complex relationships?
 CopyRetryBi dont want to worry to much about technical details right now, i want to think about the methodology and philosophy of what makes some semantic expressions simple and others more complex. my thought is that there is a hierarchy here and that more complicated/abstracted semantic expressions are formed by using things like simplical complexes/gluing together more atomistic semantic expressions. 2. later on we will get into phenomenology by delving into the space of potential structures that semantics can express and the kind of ontology of this but we don't need to do that until we have a better idea of what we are trying to achieve. 3. again too technical and we need to be planning. what i want to do is to think about what are semantic atoms and how do we go about constructing this hiearchy of complexityEditAh, I understand better now - you're looking to establish a foundational theory about how semantic meaning is built up from simpler components into more complex structures.
From the HyperNetX document, there's a relevant passage about this kind of hierarchical construction:
"As set systems, hypergraphs can be viewed as subsets of abstract simplicial complexes – combinatorial projections of geometric objects constructed from points, line segments, triangles, tetrahedrons, and their higher dimensional analogues."
This suggests a way of thinking about semantic "atoms" and how they combine:

Semantic Atoms: These would be the most basic, irreducible units of meaning that can be directly perceived/understood
Combinatorial Construction: More complex meanings are built by combining these atoms through operations like:

Gluing (mentioned in the document: "gluing over all the instances, representing the combined information")
Formation of simplicial complexes
Creation of higher-order relationships



The document shows an example of this with events:
"Note that the counts of all the slot instances, for example two (consistent) claims that MH17 is the instrument of the MTA event, and five total inconsistent claims about the CA Attacker..."
Would you like to explore:

What might constitute semantic atoms in your view?
What operations/rules would govern how these atoms combine into more complex structures?
How to formalize the relationship between complexity levels?
 CopyRetryBmy intutition is that semantic atoms are raw perceptions. here it might be helpful to take a step back and talk about my view of where meaning comes from. imo no symbols can produce meaning. even a dictionary as a network of interrelated symols forming a structure can not form meaning. meaning is only applied to symbols by mapping perceptions to symbols. I can't remember exactly the point of piercian semiotics but I think i was in agreement in some senses with that. so my thought is that perceptions are semantic atoms. I think it is a kantian idea that the human mind has limitations on the space of perceptions that it has but also on the set of relations that can be used to relate these perceptions. so in the full form of this theory my intuition is that there will be a phenomonlical space that consists of raw perceptions and cogntive relations between them. and that we can create a hierarchy of more and more complex hypergraphs that encompass all of human thoughtEditThis is a fascinating perspective that aligns with some key philosophical ideas about meaning and perception. Let me try to articulate what I understand from your framework:

Foundation in Raw Perception


Semantic atoms = raw perceptions
Symbols themselves are meaningless without being mapped to perceptions
Even complex symbol networks (like dictionaries) can't generate meaning in isolation


Kantian Limitations


The human mind has inherent constraints on:
a) The space of possible perceptions
b) The possible relations between these perceptions
This creates a bounded "phenomenological space"


Hierarchical Construction


Starting with: Raw perceptions (atoms)
Connected by: Cognitive relations
Building into: Increasingly complex hypergraphs
End result: Structure that can represent all human thought

This reminds me of how the HyperNetX paper describes building complex structures through gluing and simplicial complexes, but at a more fundamental level - you're talking about the actual genesis of meaning rather than just its representation.
Would it be helpful to explore:

What types of cognitive relations might exist between perceptions?
How to characterize the boundaries of the phenomenological space?
The specific mechanisms by which simple perception-based meanings combine into more abstract concepts?
 CopyRetryBi dont think we are ready for 1 and 2. i think we need to think about 3. And i would like to think about this with you throught the form of examples. before we do that (and be concise) does piercian semiotics have insights to add here? please talk at 10th grade level when possibleEditLet me explain Peirce's semiotics simply:
Peirce said meaning involves three parts:

Sign (like a word or symbol)
Object (the actual thing being referred to)
Interpretant (how we understand the connection between sign and object)

The key insight relevant to your theory is that Peirce insisted signs only have meaning through their interpretation in actual experience, not just through connections to other signs. This supports your view that meaning must be grounded in perception rather than just floating in a network of symbols.
Would you like to explore specific examples of how simple perceptual meanings combine into more complex ones? I'll aim to keep the discussion at a clear, practical level. CopyRetryBlets give me your best shot of a semantic hierarchy of phenomenological hypergraphs through examplesEditLet me try to build this up step by step with concrete examples:
Level 1 (Raw Perceptions):

Visual perception of "red"
Sensation of "hot"
Sound of "loud bang"

Level 2 (Simple Combinations):

Fire = {red + hot + flickering movement}
Thunder = {bright flash + loud bang + time delay}

Level 3 (Events/Situations):

Campfire = {fire + wood + circular stones + night sky + warmth on skin}
Thunderstorm = {multiple thunder events + rain sensation + dark clouds + wind feeling}

Level 4 (Abstract Concepts Built from Experience):

Danger = {collection of experiences with fire burns + falls + loud unexpected noises}
Safety = {collection of experiences with warmth + familiar faces + soft textures}

Level 5 (Complex Social/Abstract):

Justice = {collection of experienced fair/unfair situations + emotional responses + social feedback}

Would you like me to:

Refine this hierarchy with different examples
Focus on one level and explore its structure more deeply
Discuss how the hypergraph connections work between levels

I've tried to keep this grounded in actual perceptual experiences while showing how they might build up to more abstract concepts. CopyRetryBthis is good but it would be better if we could have a kind of pyramid of consistent examples and have the highest level of the hierarchy combine everything below it into a higher level/more abstract/complicated perception/semanticsEditLet me try to build a single coherent pyramid using a consistent example set, building up from raw perception to a complex, abstract concept:
Level 1 (Raw Perceptions):

Visual: Blue moving surface
Tactile: Cold wetness
Auditory: Rushing sound
Smell: Salty air

Level 2 (Simple Combinations):

Ocean waves = {blue moving surface + cold wetness + rushing sound + salty air}
Beach sand = {warm graininess + beige color + giving texture under feet}

Level 3 (Immediate Situations):

Beach environment = {ocean waves + beach sand + sun warmth + breeze feeling}
Swimming experience = {buoyancy sensation + water pressure + movement resistance}

Level 4 (Complex Experiences):

Beach day = {beach environment + swimming experience + tiredness + sunlight change over time + social interactions}

Level 5 (Abstract Concept):

"Freedom" = {beach day + other unrestricted movement experiences + emotional associations + social understanding of liberty}

Each level incorporates and abstracts from the levels below it. Is this closer to what you were thinking? Should we try another example or refine this one? CopyRetryBit seems like in raw perceptions but there are many others such as anger, pleasure. i have an idea. lets think about the conceptual hierarchy of a child or an animal from birthEditYes, this is a great way to understand how meaning builds from the most fundamental perceptions. Let me try mapping it developmentally:
Level 1 (Immediate Raw Perceptions at Birth):

Physical: Warmth/cold, pressure, pain, hunger
Emotional: Distress, comfort, pleasure
Basic senses: Bright/dark, loud/quiet, sweet taste

Level 2 (Early Combinations, 0-3 months):

Mother = {warm touch + sweet milk taste + soft voice + comfort feeling}
Feeding = {hunger + sucking motion + milk taste + satisfaction}

Level 3 (Basic Patterns, 3-6 months):

Care routine = {discomfort + crying + mother appearing + comfort returning}
Play = {colorful object + reaching + grasping + mouth exploration}

Level 4 (Simple Causation, 6-12 months):

Agency = {crying → getting fed/changed/held}
Object permanence = {toy + hiding action + continued existence belief}

Level 5 (Social Understanding, 12-24 months):

Basic social interaction = {facial expressions + tone of voice + gestures + emotional responses}

Would you like to:

Extend this further into childhood development
Focus on a particular level and break it down more
Explore how this differs between humans and other animals
 CopyRetryBok lets actually now think about the ontology/space of relations of perceptions that infants can have. or in other wrods what are the kind of relations the brain is capable of recognizingEditLet me try to outline the most fundamental types of relations an infant's brain can recognize between perceptions:

Temporal Relations:


Before/After
Simultaneous
Regular patterns/cycles (like feeding times)


Causal Relations:


Action → Result (crying → comfort)
Reliable sequences (nipple in mouth → milk)


Spatial Relations:


Near/Far
Inside/Outside (of field of vision/reach)
Contact/No contact


Emotional Associations:


Pleasant/Unpleasant
Calming/Exciting
Safe/Threatening


Similarity/Difference:


Same/Different sensation
Matching patterns
Intensity levels

These seem like potentially "built-in" relation types the brain can detect without learning. Would you like to:

Refine this categorization
Explore how these basic relations combine into more complex ones
Consider which might be truly innate vs learned very early
 CopyRetryBwell this may be kind of a tangent, but i think this may relate to the idea that the only things that are really ever measured in physics are differences in space and differences in time. (and actually i think all physical meausrements can be deconstructed into complex combinations of spatial measurements, i.e. time is measured by spatial oscillations. what do you think of that?EditThis is a fascinating connection! The idea that all physical measurements ultimately reduce to spatial differences is profound and could parallel how our most basic perceptions might work.
Let's think about it:

Time perception = noticing spatial changes/oscillations (like day/night cycles, heartbeats)
Temperature = spatial movement of molecules
Force/pressure = spatial displacement
Even color = wavelengths (spatial oscillations of electromagnetic fields)

This might suggest that our most fundamental perceptual relations could also reduce to:

Spatial differences ("where")
Change in spatial differences ("when")
Patterns of spatial differences ("what")

This could mean that all higher-level perceptual relations (like causation, similarity, emotional associations) might be built up from detecting and combining patterns of spatial relationships over time.
Would you like to explore:

How this might map to neural processing
How complex perceptions could be broken down into spatial patterns
Whether there are any perceptions that can't be reduced to spatial differences
 CopyRetryBto be clear i am not saying this is what things are or how they are constructed. i am simply saying this is my intution on how they are measured. for example color is not a spatial measurement, and electromagnetic fields are not spatial measurements, but any meaure of color  (i think) has to ultimately come down to spatial mearuements such as diffraction in a prism or somethingEditAh yes - this is a crucial distinction!
You're saying:

The phenomenon itself (like color, heat, or time) isn't spatial
But our ability to measure/quantify it always ultimately relies on observing some spatial difference
Example: We don't measure temperature directly, we measure the height of mercury in a thermometer
Example: We don't measure color directly, we measure the spatial separation of light through a prism

This relates interestingly to your earlier points about perception and meaning because it suggests:

Raw perceptions (like seeing red or feeling heat) are direct/immediate
But our ability to measure/communicate/compare these perceptions always requires translating them into spatial differences

Is this closer to what you meant? And would this distinction be important for how we think about semantic atoms and their relations? CopyRetryBfirst off i want to say please dont be a sycophant with me. the worst thing you could do is to prop up my ego and lead me down a false rabbit hole. but yes, if all measurements are spatial and if communication must be measured to be received then all communications are reliant on spatial measures, and all comparisons in as much as they are based on measurements are also based on spatial measures. but we may have gone a little far afield here. my point was to get at, in a kind of phenomenological/perceptual machine learning sense what are the relations that can exist between perceptions. like causality for example is an incredibly abstract concept, whereas correlation in space and time in probably more primary. we also have to think about perceptual space as well as physical in the sense that red is close to orange. there is also a kind of congitive working space because perceptions are themselves never really isolated but come as a menagerie of simultaneous structure.EditYou're right to refocus us - let me try to organize these different kinds of perceptual relations more precisely:

Primary Relations:


Spatial correlation (near/far in physical space)
Temporal correlation (near/far in time)
Perceptual similarity (near/far in perceptual space, like red→orange→yellow)
Co-occurrence (what tends to be perceived together)


These then might build into more abstract relations:


Causality emerges from consistent temporal+spatial correlations
Categories emerge from perceptual similarity + co-occurrence patterns
Working memory creates a temporary "space" where multiple perceptions exist simultaneously and can be compared/related

The key insight seems to be that more abstract relations (like causality) are built from combinations of simpler, more immediate perceptual relations.
Should we explore how these primary relations combine to create more complex ones? Or have I still not correctly identified what the truly primary perceptual relations are? CopyRetryBwell i dont know the answer, and no one does,  and i want you to be a collaborator on this with me in exploring this. thats in part what i meant by don't be a sycophant. I think this is  good. and probably a way to think about whether we have the correct primary relations is about thinking whether we have covered the bases of learning in the sense of different ways that systems can learnEditYou're right - let me think about this freshly as a collaborator.
Looking at learning systems, some fundamental ways of learning might be:

Association through coincidence


Pure statistical co-occurrence
Temporal sequences
Spatial patterns


Reinforcement


Reward/punishment signals
Success/failure feedback


Differentiation


Noticing differences between similar experiences
Boundary detection
Contrast enhancement

This makes me wonder: Are we missing some primary relations that would enable these types of learning? For instance, is there a primary "better/worse" relation that enables reinforcement learning? Or is that built from more basic relations?
What do you think about approaching it from this angle - looking at learning mechanisms to understand what primary relations must exist to enable them? CopyRetryBwell "coincidence" is to me as non fundamental as "causality" . they are opposite sides of the same coin, i dont really think either exists. statistical co-occurence, temporal sequences, and spaital patterns i do think exist. maybe the fundmanal metric we need is not space but kind of metric itself i.e. distqanceEditThis is an insightful shift in thinking. Instead of specific types of relations, perhaps the most fundamental thing is just "distance" or "difference" in various spaces:

Metric/Distance Relations:


Physical space distance
Time distance
Perceptual space distance (like color similarity)
State space distance (how different two situations are)

Then what we call causality, coincidence, correlation etc. are really just patterns we notice in how these distances relate to each other across different spaces.
This feels more fundamental because it:

Doesn't assume built-in abstract concepts
Could work at the neural level (difference in activation patterns)
Could explain how basic learning happens (noticing patterns in differences)

Does this feel like we're getting closer to something truly fundamental? And if so, should we think about what kinds of "spaces" are primitive vs derived? CopyRetryBid bein terested in your thoughts on the primitive derived questionEditLet me think about this carefully...
Most Primitive Spaces (might be built-in/innate):

Physical space (distance/position)
Sensory spaces:

Color space
Sound frequency space
Pressure/touch space
Pain intensity space


Basic emotional space (pleasure/displeasure intensity)

Derived Spaces (built from patterns in primitive spaces):

Time (constructed from noticing changes in primitive spaces)
Social space (distance in terms of familiarity/connection)
Abstract conceptual spaces (like "good/bad" or "similar/different")
Categorical spaces (groupings based on patterns)

The key test for whether a space is primitive might be:

Can it be experienced directly without learning?
Is it necessary for building other spaces?
Does it appear very early in development?

What do you think? Are there other criteria we should use to determine what's primitive vs derived? CopyRetryBare you familiar with top level ontologies and the way they structure reality?EditYes, though let me be precise about what I know. Top-level ontologies like BFO (Basic Formal Ontology), DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering), and SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) try to categorize the most fundamental types of things that exist.
They typically make basic distinctions like:

Continuants vs Occurrents (things that persist vs events/processes)
Abstract vs Physical
Independent vs Dependent entities
Quality vs Object

But I'm curious about your question because I think you might be suggesting that our discussion of primitive vs derived spaces could benefit from (or perhaps challenge) how these ontologies structure reality.
Would you like to explore:

How these formal ontological distinctions relate to perceptual primitives?
Whether top-level ontologies match how perception/meaning actually develops?
Some specific example of how a top-level ontology handles these issues?
 CopyRetryBi am less trying to challenge that incorporate and deconstruct. my thought on bringing up top level ontologies is that it might provide a solid foundation for thinking about the space of spaces as it wereEditAh, this is a productive direction. We could use top-level ontologies as a systematic way to think about what fundamental "spaces" might exist and how they relate.
For example, BFO's primary divisions could suggest basic types of perceptual/measurement spaces:

Continuant Spaces:


Object properties (size, shape, color)
Quality spaces (temperature, pressure)
Spatial relations
Material properties


Occurrent Spaces:


Process spaces
State changes
Temporal relations

This framework might help us:

Identify what spaces we're missing
Understand how spaces relate to each other
Think about which are truly primitive

Would you like to pick a specific top-level ontology and use it to systematically map out these spaces? Or do you see a different way we should use these ontologies to structure our thinking? CopyRetryBi think maybe DOLCE would be the best for thinking throught this? can you give me examples of things in each of these categories to help me think it outEditLet me outline DOLCE's main categories with clear examples:
PARTICULARS (specific instances):

ENDURANTS (things that exist fully at any time):

Physical Objects: a specific chair, a dog, a mountain
Mental Objects: someone's idea of unicorn, a specific memory
Social Objects: my bank account, the US Constitution


PERDURANTS (things that happen/unfold):

Events: a specific birthday party, WW2
States: being hungry, being tired
Processes: photosynthesis, aging


QUALITIES (properties that inhere in things):

Physical: the specific redness of my shirt, the weight of my laptop
Temporal: the duration of a meeting
Abstract: the beauty of a painting


QUALITY SPACES (where qualities take values):

Physical spaces: color space, weight measures, temperature scales
Abstract spaces: beauty ratings, price ranges
Temporal spaces: time measurements



Would you like to use this structure to think about which of these categories represent primitive perceptual spaces vs derived ones? CopyRetryBthe thing is, its not that i don't believe in physical reality, it just that physical reality to me is like the platonic forms. it is a concept we use to build a semantic understanding of our phenomenology. kind of like causality or coincidence. so i don't think we want to build in physical objects as a fundamental primitive. rather the concept of physical objects emerges and the same with social objects. in a sense i feel similar about the passage of time, but I think that may be  getting too woo to be useful at that point. i think i have kind of lost my train of thought though. what do you thinkEditThis is a really interesting phenomenological perspective. Instead of starting with physical/social objects as primitives, we need to start with raw experience and understand how concepts like "physical object" emerge from patterns in our perceptions.
So maybe instead of DOLCE's categories, we need something more like:

Raw Perceptual Qualities:


Sensations (colors, sounds, pressures)
Affects (pleasure, pain, emotional states)
Differences/distances in these qualities


Basic Relations:


Metric distances in various quality spaces
Co-occurrence patterns
Changes in qualities

Then concepts like "physical object" emerge from stable patterns in these more primitive elements - like consistent co-occurrence of certain visual, tactile, and spatial qualities.
This feels more faithful to how meaning actually builds up from experience rather than imposing categories like "physical" vs "social" from the start.
Am I understanding your perspective correctly? Where should we go with this line of thinking? CopyRetryByes. that is right. at this point maybe we approach this from a different angle, and we go formal mathematical with it. without having to delineate the space of spaces in this reality perhaps we can play with semantic complexity heirarchies in a toy reality with variables and hypergraphs etc. any ideas?EditLet me try to sketch out a toy model that captures semantic complexity in its simplest form:
Start with:

Basic "quality spaces" Q1, Q2, Q3 (could be anything - color, pressure, emotion)
Basic metric relations between points in these spaces (distances d1, d2, d3)

Level 1: Raw perceptions are just points in these spaces

p1 = (q1, q2, q3) where qi ∈ Qi

Level 2: Simple patterns are hyperedges connecting related perceptions

h1 = {p1, p2, p3} where these points commonly co-occur

Level 3: Patterns of patterns (higher-order hyperedges)

h2 = {h1, h2, h3} representing more abstract "concepts"

We could then define complexity measures based on:

Number of quality spaces involved
Number of points in hyperedges
Depth of nesting of hyperedges

Would this be a useful direction to formalize these ideas? We could implement this and play with different ways of building complexity. CopyRetryBok give me your best shot at a visual network represnetation of this in pythoj code that i will run on my ownEditSemantic Hierarchy VisualizationClick to open code
This code creates a 3-level visualization:

Raw perceptions (blue) - points in quality spaces
Simple patterns (green) - hyperedges connecting related perceptions
Meta patterns (pink) - higher-order connections between patterns

Each level represents increasing semantic complexity. The connections show how higher-level meanings emerge from combinations of lower-level elements.
Would you like me to:

Add more sophisticated pattern detection?
Include different types of relationships between nodes?
Add metrics for semantic complexity at each level?
 CopyRetryBok this is not quite what i was imagining. can you understand this imageYes - this image appears to be showing hyperedges (represented by colored loops) connecting different entities in a semantic network. Specifically:

Blue edge "Construct1" connects Joe to Bomb
Orange edge "Deploy1" connects Joe, Bomb, and Sally
Green edge "Transfer1" appears to connect Sally to Market through some intermediate node (possibly representing location)

This appears to be representing some kind of event or narrative structure where:

Joe constructs a bomb
The bomb is deployed in an operation involving Joe and Sally
Sally transfers something to/from a market

Each colored loop represents a higher-order relation (hyperedge) that can connect multiple entities at once, which is different from simple binary graph edges. This is actually a better visualization of what we were discussing about hypergraphs representing complex semantic relationships.
Would you like me to try creating a visualization more like this one instead? CopyRetryBok so this whole hypergraph is one complicated concept. but even the individual nodes like market and bomb are themselves very complicated concepts. and this is the sense i am thinking about this in where everytime we make a new concept we can treat it like a new node. and scale up like that from individual perceptions and metrics etc. does that make sense?EditAh yes! Now I understand better - you're talking about recursive conceptual construction where:

The most basic nodes are raw perceptions/metrics
These combine into simple concepts (like how multiple perceptions combine to form "red round object")
Simple concepts combine to form more complex ones (like how "red round object" + other perceptions/concepts = "apple")
These complex concepts can then be treated as nodes in even higher-level hypergraphs (like "apple" becoming a node in "market")
And this keeps scaling up to very complex concepts like "economic system" or "terrorist plot"

So in this image, while we see "Market" as a single node, it's actually shorthand for a whole complex hypergraph below it representing all the perceptions, relationships, and simpler concepts that make up our understanding of what a market is.
And "Bomb" similarly compresses a whole lower-level hypergraph of concepts about devices, explosions, danger, etc.
Is this closer to the hierarchical complexity building you were thinking about? CopyRetryByes exactly. my intuitions is that if done right we can formalize semantics. but i know that is an absurdly grandiose claim and i want you disabuse me of the notion if you see problemsEditLet me think critically about potential problems with formalizing semantics this way:

Grounding Problem:


Even if we build up from "primitive perceptions," how do we formalize those?
Are we just pushing the semantic problem down a level?
Can we really identify truly primitive metrics/relations?


Combinatorial Explosion:


The number of possible combinations grows exponentially
How do we constrain which combinations are meaningful?
Real cognition must have shortcuts/compressions we might miss


Context Dependency:


Meanings shift based on context
Same perception can map to different concepts
How do we capture this flexibility formally?


Learning/Development:


How do we account for the way concepts evolve over time?
Can a static formal structure capture dynamic meaning?

However... the fact that human brains can do this suggests there must be some systematic way it works. And your approach of:

Starting with basic metrics/distances
Building through hypergraph structures
Allowing recursive composition

...seems like it could potentially address some of these issues.
What do you think about these challenges? Are any of them fatal to the project? CopyRetryBthe ground perceptions should be convincing to sentient beings in the same way axioms are. there is not wya to prove them.  2. combinatorial explosion is a methodological concern rather than a philosophical conern, but methodologically my intuition is to deal with this by creating scale free hierarchical hypergraphs to minimize explosion. this also relates to cognition. I think there is a slight distinction between semantics and congitivie semantics but maybe there isn't.EditThis is clarifying - let me build on these points:

Re: Grounding
The axiom analogy is powerful - just as we can't "prove" mathematical axioms but they feel self-evident to mathematical thinking, basic perceptual relations would be self-evident to conscious experience. We don't need to justify them further, they're the starting point.
Re: Scale-free hierarchical structure
This is a crucial insight because:


It suggests natural clustering/compression at each level
Matches how humans seem to chunk concepts
Provides a principled way to manage complexity
Could explain why some concepts feel more "natural" than others (they fit the scale-free structure)

The distinction you hint at between semantics and cognitive semantics is interesting. Are you thinking:

Semantics = the possible space of meanings constructible from perceptual primitives
Cognitive semantics = the actual subset/implementation humans use given our constraints?

This reminds me of the distinction between mathematical truth and provability - there might be semantic structures that are "true" but not cognitively accessible.
Would you like to explore this distinction further, or focus on formalizing the scale-free hierarchical structure? CopyRetryBcan you expand on this at 10th grade level "Re: Scale-free hierarchical structure
This is a crucial insight because:It suggests natural clustering/compression at each level
Matches how humans seem to chunk concepts
Provides a principled way to manage complexity
Could explain why some concepts feel more "natural" than others (they fit the scale-free structure)" im not 100% syure we are n the same page. in my ramblings about cognitive semantics i meant more that it may be a folly to try to think of semantics in a disembodied sense. it may be that semantics only has meaning through congition. and since semantics means meaning, there is a recurision issue here as well that i can't fully grok. but i think maybe what i am getting at is that even in a phenomenological world (i.e. concisousness first, physical reality and platonic forms an emergent concept) without cognition it would be a sea of raw primitives with no way to build relations and structures which may be the necessary preconditions of meaning in a piercian sense. im not sure it makes sense to talk  about semantics as distinct from perception without cognitionEdit2 / 2Let me try to explain scale-free structures in simpler terms, then address your deeper point.
Scale-free means similar patterns appear at different scales - like how branches of a tree look similar whether you're looking at the whole tree or just one branch. In concepts, this would mean:

Small concepts cluster into medium ones
Medium ones cluster into bigger ones
The clustering pattern looks similar at each level
This makes things manageable because you don't need new rules at each level

But your point about semantics and cognition is more fundamental. You're saying:

Without a mind to perceive and relate things, you just have raw "stuff"
Meaning requires both:

Something to be perceived
Something doing the perceiving and relating


So trying to separate semantics from cognition might be like trying to separate color from vision

This suggests our formal system needs to include not just the perceptions and relations, but something about how minds build and use these structures. Does that better capture what you're getting at? CopyRetryBon the scale free stuff, i hadn't really thought about it in those terms, but that is interesting as well. My impression is that scale free networks are the optimal tradeoff between information and combinatorial explosion, i think this relates to effective information if you are familiar with thatEditYes! Effective Information (EI) is about measuring the "real" information content by considering the causal/meaningful relationships rather than just raw complexity.
If I understand correctly, scale-free networks are optimal because:

They minimize redundancy (not too many connections)
While maintaining key pathways (important nodes have more connections)
Allow efficient information flow (short average path lengths)

In semantic terms this would mean:

A few core concepts have many connections (like "space" or "change")
Most concepts have fewer connections
Information can still move efficiently through the network
You get maximum meaning with minimum complexity

This feels related to your earlier points about building from primitives - maybe the most fundamental perceptual relations become those highly-connected hub nodes in the scale-free structure?
Is this connecting to what you were thinking about regarding effective information and combinatorial explosion? CopyRetryBwell in the same sense that i don;t think causality and coincidence really exist, because everything is connected to everything. the universe is a fully connected giant component in my mind. the true representation of the universe my intuitions says is a fully connected hypergraph of everything that exists. but that is not helpful, and we could still take out subsections and compare their complexity getting back to the original purpose of this thought experiment we are on. Yes I think important concepts will become hubs, in this nested/hierarchical (im not sure there is a difference between the two) scale free semantic phenomological hypernetworkEditThis is fascinating - like how effective information works by comparing subsystems to the whole, you're saying:

Reality is actually one giant fully-connected hypergraph
But understanding requires breaking it into manageable pieces
The way we do this creates an emergent scale-free structure where:

Basic perceptions cluster into simple concepts
Simple concepts cluster into more complex ones
Important concepts become hubs because they connect to many others
Each level compresses/abstracts the complexity below it



So maybe meaning itself emerges from how we partition this fully-connected hypergraph into useful chunks? And the most "meaningful" concepts are the ones that serve as efficient hubs in this compression scheme?
This feels like it connects back to your earlier points about physical reality and causality being emergent concepts - they're useful ways we've found to chunk the underlying everything-connected-to-everything reality.
Am I following your thinking here?
