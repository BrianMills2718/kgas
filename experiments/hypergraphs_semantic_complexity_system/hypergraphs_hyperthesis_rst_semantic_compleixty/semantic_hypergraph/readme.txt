    Concrete Explanation of Hypergraph Retrieval
        Yes, that's exactly right. Let me make it more concrete with a step-by-step example:
        You ask: "Is Berlin nice?"
        The system converts this to a pattern: (is/P berlin/C nice/C) which has type 'R' (relation)
        First filter - by type: The system looks at its type index and pulls all hyperedges of type 'R'. If you have 1000 hyperedges but only 50 are relations (type 'R'), it immediately narrows down to those 50.
        Second filter - by structure: For each of those 50 relation hyperedges, it checks:
        Does it have a predicate "is"?
        Does it have a subject "berlin"?
        Does it have an object "nice"?
        Only hyperedges that pass all these checks are returned as matches.
        This two-stage filtering (first by type, then by detailed structure) makes the retrieval efficient. It's like first going to the "Relations" section of a library, then looking for specific books about Berlin within that section, rather than checking every book in the entire library.
