N-ary Relationship Reification Project Log
========================================

Project Goal
-----------
Develop a tool to automatically identify and transform complex n-ary relationships in knowledge graphs into more manageable and semantically clear structures through reification.

Key Components
-------------
1. Graph Analysis
   - Connected component detection
   - Community detection using Louvain method
   - Edge density analysis
   - Pattern matching for n-ary relationships

2. LLM Integration
   - GPT-4 for semantic analysis
   - Role identification
   - Pattern recognition
   - Reification recommendations

3. Visualization
   - Interactive HTML visualizations using pyvis
   - Before/after reification comparisons
   - Role-based edge labeling

Progress
--------
✓ Implemented basic graph loading and analysis
✓ Added clustering-based approach for finding potential n-ary relationships
✓ Integrated LLM analysis with clear examples and criteria
✓ Added semantic role detection for common patterns
✓ Implemented edge maintenance system
✓ Added visualization capabilities

Current Status
-------------
- Working prototype that can:
  * Find densely connected subgraphs
  * Analyze them for n-ary patterns
  * Suggest and apply reifications
  * Maintain edge consistency
  * Visualize results

Next Steps
----------
1. Add more relationship patterns
2. Improve role detection accuracy
3. Add validation metrics for reification quality
4. Enhance visualization options
5. Add undo/rollback capabilities
6. Add batch processing for large graphs

Known Issues
-----------
- Role detection sometimes defaults to "Participant"
- Visualization layout could be improved
- Need more robust pattern matching
- Limited to small-to-medium sized graphs due to computational complexity
