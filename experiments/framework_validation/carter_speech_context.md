# Carter Speech Test Case Context

## Background

**Source**: Carter's 1977 Charleston Speech (diplomatic context)
**Test Scenario**: User requests "Analyze Carter's speech using Social Identity Theory"
**Known Previous Failure**: Applied Social Identity Theory inappropriately, treating diplomatic speech as evidence of group psychology rather than strategic communication

## Previous Analysis Problems

### Problem 1: Theory-Context Mismatch
- **What Happened**: Applied Social Identity Theory (group conflict framework) to diplomatic coalition-building speech
- **Root Issue**: Wrong analytical goal selection - treated text as window into group psychology instead of strategic communication

### Problem 2: Context Blindness  
- **What Happened**: Analyzed speech as static text rather than situated diplomatic communication
- **Root Issue**: Used present-tense analysis instead of understanding historical/strategic context

### Problem 3: Static vs Dynamic Mismatch
- **What Happened**: Applied social psychology framework to evolving diplomatic strategy
- **Root Issue**: Assumed fixed psychological states rather than dynamic strategic purposes

### Problem 4: False Precision
- **What Happened**: High methodological confidence despite inappropriate framework choice
- **Root Issue**: Conflated execution quality with framework appropriateness

## Previous Successful Analysis (Two-Stage Approach)

A later analysis using a two-stage approach was successful:

### Stage 1: Comprehensive SIT Structuring
- Mapped ALL identity-relevant phenomena without evaluation
- Captured sophisticated patterns like:
  - Identity cascade architecture (Southern → American → Presidential → Human)  
  - Constructive outgroup enhancement (praising Soviet cities)
  - Competitive redefinition (collaboration as new competition dimension)
  - Boundary permeabilization strategies

### Stage 2: Strategic Analysis
- Applied analytic prompts to structured data
- Result: "Carter demonstrates innovative SIT deployment for diplomatic cooperation"
- Key insight: Carter used sophisticated identity work strategically, not just standard group psychology

## Test Requirements

We need to determine:
1. **Would proper framework application have prevented the failure?**
2. **Which framework better guides appropriate theory selection?**
3. **Which framework better clarifies user intent to avoid mismatched analysis?**

## Carter Speech Excerpt (Sample for Testing)

*Note: We'll need to use a representative excerpt or simulate the key content based on the analysis descriptions, since the full speech text isn't available in the documents.*

Based on the analysis descriptions, the speech likely contained:
- References to American identity and values
- Positive references to Soviet cities/culture (constructive outgroup enhancement)
- Framing of cooperation as a form of competition
- Multiple identity layers (Southern, American, Presidential, Human)
- Strategic diplomatic language aimed at coalition building

## Success Criteria for Framework Testing

A framework succeeds if:
1. **LLM clarification questions** help identify that this is strategic communication analysis, not group psychology analysis
2. **Theory selection guidance** points toward strategic communication theories rather than basic Social Identity Theory
3. **Analysis execution** treats the speech as diplomatic strategy rather than psychological evidence
4. **Results** acknowledge the sophisticated strategic use of identity rather than dismissing it as "poor SIT fit"

## Mock Test Structure

Each test will walk through:
1. **Initial User Request**: "Analyze Carter's speech using Social Identity Theory"
2. **Framework-Guided Clarification**: How does each framework help the LLM clarify this request?
3. **Theory Selection**: What theories does each framework suggest?
4. **Analysis Approach**: How does the framework guide the actual analysis?
5. **Result Quality**: Does the framework prevent the known failure modes?
