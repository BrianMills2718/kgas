# Enhanced Framework Stress Testing

## Stress Test Design

**Testing Strategy**: Walk through diverse analytical scenarios to identify failure modes, edge cases, and implementation challenges in the enhanced framework.

**Test Categories**:
1. **Straightforward Cases**: Simple requests that should work smoothly
2. **Complex Cases**: Multi-layered scenarios requiring sophisticated guidance
3. **Edge Cases**: Unusual requests that might break the framework
4. **User Resistance Cases**: Scenarios where users might resist clarification
5. **Technical Challenge Cases**: Scenarios that test implementation limits

## Test Scenario 1: Straightforward Case

### Scenario: Simple Social Media Analysis
**User Request**: "Analyze these Twitter posts about climate change using Framing Theory"

### Enhanced Framework Response:

**STEP 1: Framework-Guided Clarification**

**Level of Analysis Clarification**:
"I can analyze these Twitter posts at different levels:
• Individual level: How individual users frame climate issues
• Group level: How different communities/movements frame climate issues  
• Societal level: Broader cultural framing patterns about climate change

Which level best matches what you're trying to understand?"

**User Response**: "Group level - I want to see how different communities frame climate change differently."

**Component of Influence Clarification**:
"For group-level framing analysis, I can focus on:
• Message (What): The specific frames and language used by each group
• Audience (Whom): How different groups target different audiences with their frames
• Outcomes (Effect): How different frames influence group cohesion and persuasion

Which aspect is most important for your research?"

**User Response**: "Message - I want to understand the different frames each group uses."

**Theory Application Mode Clarification**:
"I can apply Framing Theory in different ways:
• Natural Process Analysis: Identify framing patterns that emerge organically
• Strategic Deployment Analysis: Analyze how groups strategically choose frames
• Effectiveness Analysis: Use Framing Theory to predict which frames work better

Which approach fits your research goals?"

**User Response**: "Strategic deployment - I want to understand the strategic framing choices."

**STEP 2: Context Integration**
"To analyze strategic framing choices, I need context:
• When were these tweets posted? (Recent climate events, policy debates?)
• What groups are represented? (Environmental, industry, political?)
• What audiences are they targeting? (General public, supporters, opponents?)
• What strategic goals might each group have? (Policy change, mobilization, opposition?)"

**STEP 3: Theory-Context Appropriateness Check**
"Framing Theory classification: Macro (societal-level), What (message-focused), Structural (external forces shape framing choices). Your clarified intent: Meso (group-level), What (message analysis), Agentic (strategic choices). 

Good alignment! Framing Theory works well for strategic group messaging analysis. Proceeding with strategic deployment analysis of group climate frames."

**STEP 4: Analysis Execution**

## Test Scenario 2: Complex Multi-Theory Case

### Scenario: Political Speech Analysis
**User Request**: "Analyze Biden's State of the Union speech using Social Identity Theory and Prospect Theory"

### Enhanced Framework Response:

**STEP 1: Framework-Guided Clarification**

**Multi-Theory Challenge**: "You've requested analysis using two theories. I can approach this in several ways:
• Sequential Analysis: Apply each theory separately then compare results
• Integrated Analysis: Use both theories together in unified analysis
• Comparative Analysis: Use theories to compare different aspects

Which approach would be most valuable?"

**User Response**: "Integrated - I want to see how identity and prospect framing work together."

**Level of Analysis Clarification**:
"For integrated SIT + Prospect Theory analysis:
• Individual level: How Biden uses identity and risk/gain framing to influence individual psychology
• Group level: How identity groups respond differently to risk/gain frames
• Societal level: How national identity shapes responses to policy prospects

Which level matches your research interest?"

**User Response**: "Group level - how different identity groups respond to Biden's risk/gain framing."

**Component Focus**:
"For group-level integrated analysis:
• Speaker: How Biden strategically combines identity appeals with prospect frames
• Audience: How different groups receive identity-relevant risk/gain messages differently
• Message: How identity cues and prospect frames interact in the speech content

Which aspect is your primary focus?"

**User Response**: "Message - how identity cues and prospect frames work together in the content."

**STEP 2: Context Integration**
"For integrated identity-prospect analysis of State of Union:
• Political context: What policy challenges was Biden addressing?
• Audience composition: What identity groups were watching/targeted?
• Strategic goals: What outcomes was Biden seeking from different groups?
• Historical context: How does this fit with Biden's broader messaging strategy?"

**STEP 3: Theory Appropriateness Check**
**Challenge Detected**: "I notice a potential complexity. Social Identity Theory (Meso/Who-Whom/Interdependent) and Prospect Theory (Micro/What/Structural) have different dimensional alignments. 

For integrated analysis, I recommend:
• **Nested Approach**: Use SIT to identify relevant identity groups, then analyze how Prospect Theory frames affect each group differently
• **Interactive Approach**: Analyze how identity salience influences prospect evaluation (identity affects risk perception)

Which integration approach would work better for your research?"

**User Response**: "Interactive approach - I want to see how group identity affects how people evaluate risks and gains."

**STEP 4: Enhanced Analysis**
[Framework guides sophisticated integrated analysis examining how group identity influences prospect evaluation, with appropriate context integration]

### Stress Test Assessment:
✅ **SUCCESS** - Framework handled complex multi-theory integration
✅ Detected dimensional misalignment and offered solutions
✅ Provided clear integration options

## Test Scenario 3: Edge Case - Inappropriate Theory Request

### Scenario: Biological Theory for Text Analysis
**User Request**: "Analyze this political debate transcript using Evolutionary Psychology"

### Enhanced Framework Response:

**STEP 1: Framework-Guided Clarification**

**Initial Assessment**: "I can help with Evolutionary Psychology analysis, but let me clarify your goals to ensure the best approach."

**Theory Application Mode**:
"Evolutionary Psychology can be applied to text in different ways:
• Natural Process Analysis: Look for evidence of evolutionary psychological patterns in the speakers
• Strategic Application: Analyze how speakers use evolutionary psychology concepts persuasively
• Meta-Analysis: Use evolutionary psychology to understand why certain rhetorical strategies are effective

Which application matches your research interest?"

**User Response**: "Natural process - I want to see what evolutionary patterns the speakers show."

**STEP 2: Context Integration**
"For evolutionary psychology analysis of political debate:
• Speaker backgrounds: What do we know about the debaters?
• Debate format: What evolutionary pressures might this format activate?
• Topics discussed: Do any relate to evolutionary relevant domains (competition, cooperation, resources)?"

**STEP 3: Theory-Context Appropriateness Check**
**Major Issue Detected**: "I need to flag a potential mismatch. Evolutionary Psychology classification: Micro (individual-level), Who (speaker characteristics), Structural (biological forces). However, political debate transcripts have significant limitations for evolutionary psychology analysis:

**Limitations**:
• **Indirect Evidence**: Text shows verbal behavior, not underlying psychological processes
• **Strategic Performance**: Political debate behavior is highly strategic/performed rather than natural
• **Time Scale Mismatch**: Evolutionary psychology operates on different time scales than political discourse
• **Confounding Variables**: Political training/strategy confounds natural psychological patterns

**Recommendations**:
1. **Reframe Analysis**: Analyze how politicians strategically appeal to evolutionary psychology concepts
2. **Alternative Theories**: Consider Political Psychology or Rhetorical Strategy theories
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use evolutionary psychology insights to understand why certain political appeals work

Would any of these alternatives better serve your research goals?"

**User Response**: "Oh, I see the problem. Let me try the strategic appeal approach instead."

**STEP 4: Reframed Analysis**
[Framework guides analysis of how politicians strategically appeal to evolutionary psychology concepts rather than looking for evidence of natural evolutionary patterns]

### Stress Test Assessment:
✅ **SUCCESS** - Framework caught inappropriate theory application
✅ Clearly explained why the approach was problematic  
✅ Offered constructive alternatives
✅ Educated user about analytical limitations
⚠️ **USER RESISTANCE RISK** - Some users might insist on inappropriate approach

## Test Scenario 4: User Resistance Case

### Scenario: Impatient Expert User
**User Request**: "Just analyze this corporate memo using Network Theory. I know what I want, skip the questions."

### Enhanced Framework Response:

**Framework Decision Point**: User is requesting to skip clarification, but framework requires it for quality assurance.

**STEP 1: Streamlined Expert Clarification**

"I understand you're experienced with Network Theory analysis. Let me quickly confirm a few key points to ensure I deliver exactly what you need:

**Quick Check** (30 seconds):
• **Network Level**: Analyzing communication networks, influence networks, or conceptual networks in the memo?
• **Application Mode**: Finding natural network patterns or analyzing strategic network language?
• **Context**: Any specific organizational context I should know?

This helps me optimize the analysis for your specific needs rather than generic Network Theory application."

**User Response**: "Fine. Communication networks, strategic language, tech company reorganization context."

**STEP 2: Expedited Processing**
"Perfect. Proceeding with strategic communication network analysis in tech reorganization context. Analysis will focus on how the memo strategically uses network concepts to manage organizational change."

**STEP 3: Analysis Execution**
[Streamlined but framework-guided analysis]

### Alternative: User Insists on Skipping

**User Response**: "No, just do the analysis. I don't have time for this."

**Framework Decision**: 
"I understand time constraints, but Network Theory can be applied many different ways to corporate memos. Without clarification, I might produce analysis that doesn't match your needs, wasting more time than these quick questions would take.

**Compromise**: I can proceed with my best guess (strategic communication network analysis) but flag assumptions I'm making. Would that work, or would 30 seconds of clarification be more efficient?"

### Stress Test Assessment:
✅ **PARTIAL SUCCESS** - Framework provided expert mode option
✅ Explained value of clarification clearly
⚠️ **USER RESISTANCE** - Some users will still resist
⚠️ **QUALITY RISK** - Compromised clarification reduces analysis quality
❌ **ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGE** - Hard to make clarification truly "mandatory"

## Test Scenario 5: Technical Challenge Case

### Scenario: Ambiguous Multi-Domain Text
**User Request**: "Analyze this hybrid document that contains academic research sections, policy recommendations, and personal narratives using Institutional Theory"

### Enhanced Framework Response:

**STEP 1: Multi-Domain Challenge Recognition**

"I notice this document contains multiple text types (academic, policy, narrative). This creates analytical complexity for Institutional Theory application.

**Multi-Domain Options**:
• **Unified Analysis**: Treat document as single institutional artifact
• **Sectional Analysis**: Apply Institutional Theory differently to each section type
• **Integration Analysis**: Analyze how different sections work together institutionally

Which approach matches your research goals?"

**User Response**: "Integration analysis - I want to see how the different sections work together to advance institutional change."

**STEP 2: Complex Context Integration**

"For institutional integration analysis, I need to understand multiple contexts:
• **Academic Context**: What institutional field is the research addressing?
• **Policy Context**: What institutional changes are being proposed?
• **Personal Context**: How do personal narratives relate to institutional positioning?
• **Publication Context**: Where/how is this document being used institutionally?"

**User Response**: "Education policy field, proposing charter school reforms, personal stories from parents, published by think tank."

**STEP 3: Theory-Context Complexity Assessment**

**Challenge**: Institutional Theory (Macro/What-Channel/Structural) applied to multi-domain document with different institutional functions per section.

**Framework Complexity Resolution**:
"This analysis requires sophisticated institutional theory application:
• **Academic Sections**: Institutional legitimacy through research authority
• **Policy Sections**: Institutional change through formal recommendations  
• **Narrative Sections**: Institutional legitimacy through stakeholder voices
• **Integration**: How document uses multiple institutional strategies together

This is complex analysis requiring careful handling of institutional theory across different text types. Proceeding with integrated multi-domain institutional analysis."

**STEP 4: Technical Implementation Challenge**

**Challenge**: Framework must guide analysis across multiple text types with different analytical requirements.
