# Test 2: Alternative Multi-Dimensional Framework

## Framework Being Tested

**Alternative Framework from Thinking_out_loud**: Multi-dimensional analysis matrix
- **Object of Study**: Text-as-object vs Text-as-window
- **Type of Claim**: Empirical/Interpretive/Evaluative/Constructive  
- **Additional Dimensions**: Temporal orientation (retrospective/present/prospective), Inference levels (direct/inferred/theorized)

**Framework Purposes**:
1. **Goal Specification**: Explicit analytical goal before theory selection
2. **Boundary Clarification**: Clear distinction between analyzing text vs. using text to analyze world
3. **Claim Type Precision**: Specify what kind of claims the analysis will make

## Mock Test Walkthrough

### Step 1: Initial User Request
**User**: "Analyze Carter's speech using Social Identity Theory"

### Step 2: Framework-Guided LLM Clarification

**LLM Internal Process** (using multi-dimensional framework):
- User request is ambiguous across multiple dimensions
- Need to clarify: Object of study (text properties vs external phenomena)
- Need to clarify: Type of claim (what kind of conclusions?)
- Need to clarify: Temporal orientation and inference level

**LLM Clarification to User**:
"I'd like to help you analyze Carter's speech with Social Identity Theory, but first I need to clarify your analytical goals to ensure I provide exactly what you need.

**What are you trying to analyze?**
- **Text-as-object**: The speech's linguistic properties, rhetorical structure, how it uses identity language
- **Text-as-window**: What the speech reveals about Carter's psychology, political situation, or diplomatic strategy

**What type of conclusions do you want?**
- **Empirical**: What identity patterns actually exist in the speech
- **Interpretive**: What the identity patterns mean or represent  
- **Evaluative**: How effective the identity strategies are
- **Constructive**: How the identity approach could be improved

**What time frame interests you?**
- **Retrospective**: Understanding why Carter spoke this way given historical context
- **Present**: Analyzing the speech's properties as they exist
- **Prospective**: Predicting what effects the speech would have

Could you help me understand which combination best matches your research goals?"

### Step 3: User Response (Simulated)
**User**: "I want to understand what the speech reveals about Carter's diplomatic strategy - so text-as-window, interpretive claims about what his identity work means strategically, with retrospective understanding of why he chose this approach."

### Step 4: Framework-Guided Analysis Specification

**LLM Internal Process**:
- Object: Text-as-window (using speech to understand external phenomena)
- Claim type: Interpretive (what strategic identity work means)
- Temporal: Retrospective (why Carter chose this approach)
- This specifies: Strategic communication analysis, not psychological evidence analysis

**LLM Analysis Approach Specification**:
"Perfect! Based on your clarification, I'll analyze:

**Analytical Approach**:
- **Object of Study**: Text-as-window into Carter's diplomatic strategy
- **Type of Analysis**: Interpretive claims about strategic meaning of identity work
- **Temporal Frame**: Retrospective analysis of strategic choices given historical context
- **Inference Level**: Theorized inference using Social Identity Theory concepts to interpret strategic decisions

**This means I'll**:
- Use the speech as evidence of Carter's strategic thinking
- Interpret identity language as deliberate strategic choices
- Apply SIT concepts to understand the strategic logic
- Consider historical diplomatic context that shaped these choices

**I will NOT**:
- Treat the speech as evidence of Carter's personal group psychology
- Make claims about natural group processes
- Analyze text properties divorced from strategic context

Does this approach match your research interests?"

### Step 5: Analysis Execution

**LLM Analysis** (framework-guided):
"**Strategic Identity Architecture in Carter's Diplomatic Communication**

*Using Social Identity Theory concepts to interpret Carter's strategic diplomatic choices*

**Strategic Object of Analysis**: Using speech content to understand Carter's diplomatic identity strategy, not Carter's personal psychology.

**Interpretive Analysis of Strategic Identity Work**:

**1. Multi-Layered Identity Positioning (Strategic Interpretation)**
- **Textual Evidence**: Carter references Southern heritage, American values, Presidential authority, human universals
- **Strategic Interpretation**: Deliberate identity flexibility - different audiences can connect with different identity layers
- **SIT Framework Application**: Uses multiple group memberships strategically rather than exhibiting single group identity

**2. Constructive Outgroup Enhancement Strategy (Strategic Interpretation)**  
- **Textual Evidence**: Positive references to Soviet achievements, cultural praise
- **Strategic Interpretation**: Violates standard SIT outgroup derogation to serve diplomatic cooperation goals
- **SIT Framework Application**: Strategic manipulation of intergroup bias patterns for diplomatic ends

**3. Competition Redefinition Strategy (Strategic Interpretation)**
- **Textual Evidence**: Frames cooperation as competitive achievement
- **Strategic Interpretation**: Maintains American competitive identity while enabling collaborative behavior
- **SIT Framework Application**: Redefines group competition dimensions to allow cooperation without identity threat

**Retrospective Contextual Analysis**:
Given 1977 Cold War diplomatic context, Carter needed to:
- Maintain American strength identity (domestic political requirement)
- Enable Soviet cooperation (diplomatic requirement)  
- Build bipartisan support (political requirement)

His identity strategy serves all three goals simultaneously through sophisticated SIT concept deployment.

**Conclusion**: Carter demonstrates strategic mastery of identity psychology principles, using SIT concepts as diplomatic tools rather than exhibiting natural group psychological processes."

### Step 6: Result Quality Assessment

**Strengths of Framework-Guided Analysis**:
1. **Explicit Goal Specification**: Framework forced clear articulation of analytical goals before analysis
2. **Prevented Object Confusion**: Clear text-as-window specification prevented treating speech as psychological evidence
3. **Claim Type Precision**: Interpretive focus ensured strategic meaning interpretation rather than empirical group psychology claims
4. **Temporal Contextualization**: Retrospective frame ensured historical diplomatic context consideration

**Comparison to Test 1**:
- **More Explicit**: Framework required upfront goal specification vs. mid-process clarification
- **Clearer Boundaries**: Text-as-window vs text-as-object distinction clearer than three-dimensional classification
- **Better Context Integration**: Temporal dimension explicitly brought in historical context

## Framework Performance Analysis

### Success Criteria Evaluation

1. **LLM Clarification Quality**: ✓ **EXCELLENT** - Framework required systematic clarification across all analytical dimensions
2. **Theory Selection Guidance**: ✓ **EXCELLENT** - Framework specifications clearly guided appropriate SIT application approach
3. **Analysis Approach**: ✓ **EXCELLENT** - Framework prevented psychological interpretation, ensured strategic analysis
4. **Result Quality**: ✓ **EXCELLENT** - Framework produced coherent strategic analysis with explicit analytical boundaries

### Key Framework Mechanisms That Worked

1. **Mandatory Goal Specification**: Framework required explicit analytical goal articulation before proceeding
2. **Dimensional Orthogonality**: Text-as-object vs text-as-window created clear, non-overlapping categories
3. **Claim Type Precision**: Empirical/Interpretive/Evaluative/Constructive forced precision about conclusion types
4. **Multi-Dimensional Integration**: Framework ensured consideration of temporal and inferential dimensions

### Advantages Over Original Framework

1. **More Systematic**: Required clarification across all dimensions rather than optional clarification
2. **Clearer Categories**: Text-as-object vs text-as-window clearer than Level/Component/Metatheory classifications  
3. **Goal-Driven**: Explicit goal specification prevents mismatch between request and intent
4. **Context Integration**: Temporal dimension systematically brings in contextual considerations

### Potential Limitations

1. **User Burden**: Requires more extensive user clarification process
2. **Complexity**: Multiple dimensions might be overwhelming for simple requests
3. **Over-Specification**: Might create unnecessary complexity for straightforward analyses

## Overall Assessment: SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE

The alternative multi-dimensional framework performed better than the original framework by:

1. **Preventing Analysis Confusion**: Mandatory goal specification prevented theory-context mismatch
2. **Ensuring Systematic Clarification**: Required clarification across all analytical dimensions
3. **Producing Higher Quality Analysis**: Results showed clearer analytical boundaries and better context integration

**Key Success Factors**:
- **Mandatory Goal Specification**: Prevented proceeding with ambiguous requests
- **Clear Object Distinction**: Text-as-object vs text-as-window eliminated confusion about what was being analyzed
- **Systematic Dimensional Coverage**: Ensured all relevant analytical aspects were considered

**Critical Insight**: The alternative framework's requirement for explicit goal specification before theory application appears to be the key mechanism for preventing the Carter analysis failure mode.
