# Test 1: Original Three-Dimensional Framework

## Framework Being Tested

**Original KGAS Framework**: Three-dimensional theory classification
- **Level of Analysis**: Micro/Meso/Macro (individual/group/societal)
- **Component of Influence**: Who/Whom/What/Channel/Effect (speaker/audience/message/medium/outcome)  
- **Causal Metatheory**: Agentic/Structural/Interdependent (individual agency/external structures/feedback loops)

**Framework Purposes**:
1. **Academic Categorization**: Organize theories by operational purpose
2. **System Guidance**: Help LLM clarify user requests
3. **Theory Discovery**: Aid in finding relevant theories for analytical requests

## Mock Test Walkthrough

### Step 1: Initial User Request
**User**: "Analyze Carter's speech using Social Identity Theory"

### Step 2: Framework-Guided LLM Clarification

**LLM Internal Process** (using three-dimensional framework):
- Social Identity Theory classification: Meso (group-level), Who+Whom (speaker/audience dynamics), Interdependent (feedback between agents and structures)
- User request suggests group-level analysis of speaker-audience dynamics
- Framework suggests this is appropriate match

**LLM Clarification to User**:
"I can analyze Carter's speech using Social Identity Theory. To ensure I provide the most useful analysis, could you clarify what aspect you're most interested in?

- **Group Dynamics Analysis**: How Carter positions different groups (Americans, Soviets, etc.) and creates in-group/out-group distinctions
- **Speaker Identity**: How Carter constructs and presents his own identity in relation to various groups
- **Audience Influence**: How the speech is designed to affect audience group identifications and loyalties
- **Strategic Communication**: How Carter uses group identity concepts as tools for diplomatic purposes

Which of these directions would be most valuable for your research?"

### Step 3: User Response (Simulated)
**User**: "I'm interested in how Carter uses group identity concepts strategically for diplomatic purposes."

### Step 4: Framework-Guided Theory Selection

**LLM Internal Process**:
- User clarified intent: strategic communication analysis
- Original request was Social Identity Theory
- Framework classification: SIT is Meso/Who+Whom/Interdependent
- User intent suggests: What (message)/Channel (diplomatic)/Effect (strategic outcomes)
- **Framework guidance**: Look for theories that better match What/Channel/Effect focus

**LLM Theory Selection**:
"Based on your interest in strategic diplomatic communication, I can approach this analysis in several ways:

1. **Pure Social Identity Theory**: Focus on group categorization and identity processes in the speech
2. **Strategic Communication Theory**: Analyze how Carter uses identity concepts as persuasive tools
3. **Diplomatic Communication Analysis**: Examine identity framing as diplomatic strategy
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Use SIT concepts within a strategic communication framework

Given your interest in strategic purposes, I recommend Option 4 - using Social Identity Theory concepts but within a strategic communication framework. This will analyze how Carter strategically deploys group identity concepts rather than treating them as evidence of natural group psychology.

Does this approach align with your research goals?"

### Step 5: Analysis Execution

**LLM Analysis** (framework-guided):
"**Strategic Use of Social Identity Theory Concepts in Carter's Diplomatic Speech**

Carter's speech demonstrates sophisticated strategic deployment of Social Identity Theory concepts for diplomatic purposes:

**Strategic Identity Positioning**:
- **Multiple Identity Layers**: Carter positions himself as Southern (relatable), American (patriotic), Presidential (authoritative), and Human (universal) - creating strategic flexibility
- **Purpose**: Each identity layer serves different diplomatic functions rather than reflecting natural group membership

**Constructive Outgroup Enhancement**:
- **Strategy**: Praises Soviet cities and culture (positive outgroup references)
- **Traditional SIT**: This would be anomalous (violates outgroup derogation principle)
- **Strategic Analysis**: This serves diplomatic cooperation goals by reducing threat perception

**Redefinition of Competition**:
- **Strategy**: Frames cooperation itself as a form of competition ('competing to cooperate')
- **Purpose**: Maintains American competitive identity while enabling collaborative behavior

**Assessment**: Carter demonstrates sophisticated understanding of identity psychology, using SIT concepts as diplomatic tools rather than exhibiting natural group processes. This represents strategic communication using psychological insights rather than evidence of group psychology."

### Step 6: Result Quality Assessment

**Strengths of Framework-Guided Analysis**:
1. **Prevented Theory-Context Mismatch**: Framework helped LLM recognize strategic vs. psychological analysis distinction
2. **Enabled Appropriate Clarification**: LLM asked questions that revealed user's strategic communication interest
3. **Guided Proper Theory Selection**: Recommended hybrid approach rather than pure SIT application
4. **Produced Coherent Analysis**: Results treat speech as strategic communication using identity concepts

**Weaknesses**:
1. **Required User Clarification**: Framework didn't automatically detect the mismatch - needed user guidance
2. **Theory Classification Complexity**: SIT could be classified multiple ways depending on how it's applied
3. **Still Allows Misapplication**: User could have insisted on pure SIT approach despite framework guidance

## Framework Performance Analysis

### Success Criteria Evaluation

1. **LLM Clarification Quality**: ✓ **SUCCESS** - Framework guided meaningful clarifying questions that revealed strategic communication intent
2. **Theory Selection Guidance**: ✓ **SUCCESS** - Framework helped identify mismatch and suggest hybrid approach  
3. **Analysis Approach**: ✓ **SUCCESS** - Framework guided treatment as strategic communication rather than psychology
4. **Result Quality**: ✓ **SUCCESS** - Framework prevented known failure modes and produced coherent strategic analysis

### Key Framework Mechanisms That Worked

1. **Multi-dimensional Classification**: Helped identify that user request (Meso/Who+Whom) didn't match user intent (What/Channel/Effect)
2. **Theory Discovery Purpose**: Framework's theory categorization helped LLM recognize more appropriate theoretical approaches
3. **Clarification Guidance**: Framework provided structure for asking meaningful clarifying questions

### Limitations Observed

1. **User Dependency**: Framework required user clarification to work properly - didn't automatically prevent mismatch
2. **Classification Ambiguity**: Same theory (SIT) could be classified differently depending on application context
3. **Implementation Complexity**: Required sophisticated LLM reasoning to apply framework effectively

## Overall Assessment: SUCCESSFUL

The original three-dimensional framework, when properly applied to its intended purposes (LLM guidance, theory discovery, request clarification), successfully prevented the known failure modes from the Carter analysis.

**Key Success Factor**: Framework guided the LLM to ask clarifying questions that revealed the mismatch between the user's stated request (SIT) and their actual intent (strategic communication analysis).

**Critical Insight**: The previous Carter analysis failure may have been due to improper framework implementation rather than framework inadequacy - the framework needed to be used for request clarification, not just theory application.
