    Section 1: Introduction
    The Knowledge Graph Augmentation System (KGAS) was developed by Brian Chhun
    at the University of Melbourne. This groundbreaking system introduces
    uncertainty propagation in knowledge management pipelines.
    
    Section 2: Methodology  
    Dr. Sarah Chen contributed to the mathematical foundations. The system
    uses physics-style error propagation where confidence = ∏(1 - uᵢ).
    Each tool in the pipeline tracks its own uncertainty assessment.
    
    Section 3: Implementation
    The framework integrates with Neo4j for graph storage and SQLite for
    metrics storage. The CrossModalService enables seamless conversion
    between different data representations.
    
    Section 4: Results
    Initial experiments show combined uncertainties ranging from 0.25 to 0.45
    for typical pipelines. The system successfully integrated multiple tools.
    
    Section 5: Conclusion
    KGAS demonstrates that uncertainty can be effectively tracked through
    complex knowledge processing pipelines. Future work will expand the
    tool ecosystem and refine the uncertainty model.
