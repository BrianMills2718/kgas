    In a groundbreaking announcement at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,
    tech giants Apple, Microsoft, and Google unveiled a joint initiative to combat
    climate change. CEOs Tim Cook, Satya Nadella, and Sundar Pichai committed
    $10 billion to renewable energy projects across Europe and Asia. The European Union
    praised the initiative, with President Ursula von der Leyen calling it
    "a crucial step toward carbon neutrality by 2050."
